# Service Failure in a Sharing Economy

This project is coded to efficiently sift through hundreds of Trust Pilot URLs and pick out important data such as names, locations, stars, dates, titles, and content. The script can be used for any company that is on Trust Pilot and has been run on AirBnb, airbnb_out.csv, and Uber, uber_out.csv. This code is the beginning of Sharing Economy project and is meant to gather large amounts of data for future use. This code primarily uses Python’s Request to pull html data from websites, BeautifulSoup library to parse the html data, and Pandas library to zip the data into a csv file. The next step is to clean and process this data, then feed it into a machine learning model.
