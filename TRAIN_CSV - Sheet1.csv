Fair enough, more dedicated host will mean a better website for guests. But remember that you all have to pay for the website (unless they make think the contrary). and at the end of the year, it's really a LOT of money. much more than on websites working on annual fees.

Of course, AirBnB is not paying you for this, it only increases your ranking for a certain amount of time. AirBnB tries to make you think you belong to a community and that's it's so cool. sure... The idea behind AirBnB is to use the system created by CouchSurfing and to make people pay for it. smart move but that of course kills the community. So please stop lying, just accept we're all here for the money, not to meet strangers from everywhere and blablabla. For this, go to CouchSurfing and similar websites instead. AirBnB is NOT cool so let's see yourself in the mirror ! Apart from that, always remember that from both ends (owners and guests), AirBnB is very expensive !!! Up to 20% commission (+3% on the owners) when other websites are asking for nothing ! even some regular rental agencies (where the promotion and the answers to requests are all done by the rental agencies) are less expensive than this. Final con : AirBnB promotes delation. if you're trying to talk to someone out of the system, AirBnB is asking your correspondent to flag you so you can get kicked out of their website. It's understable but it also means that the AirBnB platform is not interesting enough to make you stay inside the system. Of course, getting guests outside the system is MUCH better (and many guests are asking for it so that they don't have to pay the big commission).

"""The first two reservations I made went smoothly. Re: the third reservation I made through airbnb, the host had listed a holding deposit as requirement. This amount was to be authorised but not charged to my card and the charge voided 48 hours after checkout. I had my internet banking window open in another tab when making the reservation as I never ever keep funds in a bank account which can be accessed via an ATM card as such, when making any purchase no matter how small online or offline, I AM forced to transfer funds from my one account (which although linked does not have an ATM card option) to that of my credit/debit card account. Therefore to ensure I had transferred a sufficient amount I kept the window open in the event that I had miscalculated and would have to transfer further funds. The moment I made the payment, I switched tabs to confirm the amount deducted and that it was indeed enough. The stay was R420 so when I confirmed that R1240 had gone off naturally I assumed it was the deposit fee as well as there was only ONE deduction and not one for R420 and another for R820/the deposit. 10 days later I contacted the host who contacted Airbnb who insisted email after email that they had not deducted any deposit. I left it and put it down to some sort of error in calculations or some unforseen deduction. A week later I made another reservation (1 March 2013) and following the correct channels as set out on the website, I clicked 'book' under the relevant apartment. Airbnb's terms state that one has to 'book' whereup the total charge for the stay is authorised to the card BUT state that it is not charged pending the hosts acceptance or decline of the reservation request. The host has 24 hours in which to accept or decline and should he/she decline, the charge is voided. It is now 24 hours later... the charge has not been voided despite the host having declined the request a mere 3 hours after my making it.

I saw that airbnb credited the money on my account and added some 80 euro if I need to book new more expensive place to stay. But when I opened my account, I saw that I can't book anything because my account was temporarily blocked because they needed some few extra documents on my property listed there (and I sent them already a day before).

"""My first experience with Airbnb, not a good one. To encourage customers to spend more, Airbnb scale their service fee from 6% - 12%, more you spend less service fee you pay. For hosts of properties, they need to pay 3% service fee to Airbnb on every booking. I have my eye on a studio flat in Hong Kong for my summer vacation with my family. I was planning to stay for a month but the flat only available for the first 2 weeks and last week. At first I hesitated but at the end I decided to go for it. They treated my booking as 2 separated reservations charged me 10% for the first period of time and 12% for the 2nd period of time. I thought it was a mistake due to their system format and not to mention it was against what they committed to customer - spend more and pay less. Sent my inquiry and got negative response after a day, advised me to renegotiate with the host for a discount instead because he is paying 3% service charge (seems to me they are suggesting me to go get the host because he is paying lower service charge than I do?). Naturally, I was not satisfied with the reply, thought their response was slow, unprofessional and feel uncomfortable with their artificial 'nice' tone.

Is this the kind of service I paid for, absolutely not. For the payment policy, my booking is almost US$2000, 3 months away from my stay and I have to pay upfront right when the time booking was confirmed.

The site makes no reasonable attempt to ensure the guests safety though it advertises itself as a community built on trust. For example, there are several reports of negative host ratings being deleted. Therefore, the potential guest does not have reliable data to make an informed decision. The guest is not guaranteed a lock for their room, hence the safety of the guest is severely compromised. The site does not conduct background checks on hosts.

We get no information about a prospective tenant till airbnb has charged their ccard. If that tenat wants to cancel airbnb keeps a fee , we get nothing . We also would get the money for the rental days later, after the tenant moved in . We are not renting the home to anyone with a ccard. On top of that airbnb tells people on their website, that they verify the rentals which they do not. People get also warned, that an owner, who talks directly to a prospective tenant, will charge them the whole rental amount before they move in , especially cash and that is Fraud. In fact we rented out a home in Palm Spring many times. It is much better to talk to a tenant directly, so everyone gets a feel for the place and the people involved. Furthermore no one was asked to pay ahead . Just a deposit to hold the date , usually through paypal. Not a big amount . The reminder of the sum for the entire rental was paid in cashirs check at the day of the move in , once the tenant and owner meet at the house to exchange the keys. Airbnb prohibits the owner to contact the tenant before booking , since you never get a email or tel number of each other, only chaperoned messages through their channels . So only after the full amount is paid by ccard to airbnb, the owner gets the tenants full name and tel number. In that case, if the owner does not want to go forward with the rental, at least airbnb has their fee. This sound like a rip off to us. We will not participate in that booking site ever again. The only way I can see this site make any sense is, you are looking for a roommate in your rented apartment or own condo. You might get into a problem if your landlord does not agree to that , but at least you are there with the prospective tenant and have some security . Technically one can rent a luxury home through airbnb and then rob it later. all that for a couple of daysrental fee. . Not a good deal at all for the homeowner . We are staying away from it . No security for the owner , little for a prospective tenant since the owner can pull away and the ccard is already charged. Good luck getting that back . """,67,System Failure -- Airbnb,,,,TRUE,,,
"The rental (a beach house in San Diego, when we took our pre-baby vacation) we had was moldy, the owner was uncaring and uncooperative. We had no choice but to leave the house and find a hotel to stay for the rest of our vacation. When we wrote a bad review for him, he tried to threaten us with writing us an equally bad review. When we didn’t respond, he tried to bribe us by offering a small amount of money to take down our review. We tried to get AirBnb to intervene, and all they said was that he wasn’t supposed to do that (but they still kept him). A few weeks later (when we didn’t respond to his bribes), the owner starting calling MY cell phone. I hung up on him (or not picking up the phone), but it was obviously distressing. AirBnb did not help, and kept the owner online running his rentals. After all this, Airbnb did not kick him off – so it makes me scared what other kind of crazy people are on there. When my husband called the owner back to tell him to stop bothering me, the owner called me many horrible names. This conversation was recorded and sent to Airbnb’s safety department. They said there was nothing they could do for us. The owner remained on Airbnb. So I just deleted our account from there, I’m done with them, I don’t even care if the review is gone because we deleted our profile (but that's how bad reviews, I'm sure, mysteriously disappear). I have neighbors who rent rooms off Airbnb and kudos to them, I wish them the best of luck and pray for their safety. But for us – we are through with such unprofessional care. This would have never happened at a regular hotel, so that’s just what we’ll stick with. We enjoyed the rest of our vacation despite that major inconvenience, and a month later we get harrassed?

I've signed in though Facebook and I've provided a phone number, but apparently the document scan procedure is where something goes wrong. I've uploaded it like 7 times, and got a 'Thank you blah-blah' message each time, yet the system still doesn't recognize me as a verified user. Customer support is non-existent.

"""Like most I was impressed by what looked like a professional accommodation booking website based around social media and feedback, instead I am appalled and would never recommend using them again. As well as being a victim of fraud on 2 occasions in the space of weeks after using AIRBNB. Firstly, I booked numerous apartments for a European trip. After making an enquiry I was contacted by AIRBNB advising that the HOST was genuine and that he had been vetted. I then received additional correspondence from AIRBNB verifying various information about my stay and answering concerns I had regarding the method of booking. All of these emails were identical templates to what AIRBNB use. 5 days prior to departing I was contacting the various hosts to confirm arrivals, only to find my Paris accommodation had been a SCAM. Upon contacting AIRBNB they were most unhelpful and basically said that it was not done through their website so bad luck! The fact that all correspondence appeared to have come from them was not even a concern for them. Also the fact that they do not vet hosts to the same standard as Guests is a MAJOR WARNING SIGN. I lost a significant amount of money as well as having to find emergency accommodation that was triple what I had booked and paid for. I reported the incident to the Police and also the various SCAM websites. AIRBNB offered a voucher that was valued at less than a third of what was fraudulently taken and a window of use that was completely ridiculous, especially after having booked and paid for all of our European accommodation already. Furthermore just before departing for my trip the credit card I had used to book my accommodation through AIRBNB had been fraudulently used. My identity had been stolen and given that all of these details are held on AIRBNB one can only deduce. This has also now been reported to Police and they are investigating. If you have also been the victim of a scam or fraud through AIRBNB please contact me as I am now seeking legal advice on how to pursue AIRBNB. They should not be allowed to make such huge amounts of money when they are leaving behind victims! """,70,System Failure -- Airbnb,Functional Failure -- Airbnb,,,TRUE,TRUE,,

"I originally signed up for a long-term rental at 999 Euro per month. During this period I am wanting to change the checkout date to leave a month earlier. When attempting to make the amendment either myself or by the host, the monthly cost has escalated massively. When the host put in the amendment the monthly cost has increased to 1467 Euros from the original 999 Euro charge. If I change the date myself to just over a month in advance (giving ample 'long-term' notification) I'm quoted 2671 Euros! Whether this includes the 999 Euros for the first month which I've already paid is completely unclear to me. But even if it did, that would entail a monthly rate not dissimilar to that quoted to me when the host made the amendment herself. I have been touch with Airbnb and asked them if there is a penalty charge involved. I'm told no. Each time I'm asked to get in touch with the host directly and sort it out. She's a wonderful lady and agrees entirely that the 999 Euros should apply and is both shocked and annoyed with the inflated cost by airbnb.com. If I was wanting to checkout in under a month then it would be unstandable that the daily rate would increase due to what is then considered a short-term booking, however this is not the case as my checkout date is almost 5 week's away. Frankly at this stage I'd like to settle directly with her in cash but am afraid airbnb.com will make further deductions without my consent as they have my credit card details. At this point I've encountered many days of stress over this matter, it's been a nightmare. If only the calculated costs were the same (or close to) that originally quoted then I'd be a most happy customer, willingly paying the remainder at the agreed rate.

I start getting messages from the daughter that I owe her $89 and have repeatedly broken the house rules that there be no visitors. I'm shocked considering the message I have from her that says my fiancé would be okay to stay for two days once a month for free! I repeatedly reference the message and tell her I won't pay. After that neither of them say anything to me, but the mother comes into the apartment with another woman and two small children who are SCREAMING! The children spend the night over the weekend, and are running all over the apartment early in the morning. I had no notice this would happen, as the add on AirBnB says children are not allowed in the apartment. AirBnB was no help at all during this process, and they basically stated they have no control over the renters or additional fees.

Strange that we have never had such problems in any cities in the world for the last thirty years or so. I am considering taking legal action against the host. What I do know is that Air BnB clearly has unscrupulous people like this that do not take valid criticism in their stride.

AirBnB customer service does not protect its customers. My story is not the first nor will it be the last. I stayed in an unacceptable hosting environment (there was no heat in sub-zero temperatures, in one of the coldest nights in history according to weather.com) and while AirBnB kindly refunded me, they also asked me to post a review of the host to """"keep AirBnB honest."""" I hesitated, as last time I posted a less-than-favorable review, the host retaliated and posted completely false and damaging things on my profile. I was able to get it removed by removing my original review, and I see the host continues to do the same things to anyone who makes any kind of complaint on her property. However, the host seemed relatively nice/stable so I posted a fair but honest review of my experience. The host went nuts, calling me (as well as my friend who stayed with me) twice a day, harassing us to take the review down, and when I asked her to stop calling me, she sent me multiple messages via AirBnB, and even after AirBnB asked her to stop calling me, she continued to harass me. She then went the extra mile and wrote a false, damaging, and defaming review on my profile. I contacted AirBnB and asked them to take action, or at least to remove the review on my page. They responded in a fairly sarcastic way, saying that while they were removing parts of MY review because it referenced some of the actions of the AirBnB staff (such as the fact that they gave me a refund), they would not remove any parts of the host's review. Nor were they taking any further action about the fact that this woman was harassing me-- so I'm guessing she will have free reign in the future to harass customers who don't completely agree with the substandard conditions of her property. They ended the email with a snarky """"I'm sure you'll get great reviews in the future"""" and basically put the blame on my friend and I. The fact that I am being harassed because I posted a fair and balanced review outlining the facts of a host that offered an unacceptable hosting situation and AirBnB chooses to protect the host tells you all you need to know. Sure, if you are in a good situation with AirBnB, you'll be fine, but the minute you need protection, you are screwed. Don't bother. It is not worth the headache or money saved.

Even i already paid 30 euro cleaning fee, the cleaning lady want me to throw my trash (which is shopping bag only) opposite the building, it is not her job. Her job is only to make the bed and change the linen. She then wrote me a lie review saying i flooded the bathroom when it is never happen.

He speak in italian and expect us to understand. I dont mind. She was so nice when we check out but end up she was so angry when writing reviews. And said i texted her every 5 mins in airbnb app when her place dont have wifi and i dont have local simcard.

I worked in the trust&safety Department of airbnb and checked new listings and hosts on a daily base. The interesting fact I approached there is the low security standards airbnb put on potential new hosts and jeopardize the safety of all guests. If you want to host airbnb guests you can grab any pictures from the internet like a nice five star villa or a beautiful castle and declare yourself as the `official owner` of this listing, you do not need to provide any form of ID or Proof of Ownership like a Utility bill of the listing. This means in fact that almost more than 50 Percent of the listings on airbnb are fake or put from drug dealers or other criminals to make `the easy money` with the dumb tourists. Trust&Safety just work this way, that they take a look on the Pictures of the listing and declare them as genuine or not. There is no background-check put in place what kind of host you can expect (even serial-killer or Drug Dealers could be hosts at airbnb) . And if the host need to provide a ID they can easely fool the automated security system by providing any kind of Photo ID, the automated system called Jumio accept even Library ID`s .

"""We'd been with Airbnb for 2 years and had actually no issues with them and we thought it was great because you could review guests as much as the guests could review you. We had a lot of great guests and truly enjoyed hosting. We had people in our home sometimes and also in our apartment in a close by town. I used to recommend them to loads of people. However, our opinion has changed radically - and so much so that I think we need to warn others of their slimey business practices - practices that we think likely violate European laws for both libel and rental contracts in many countries. We experienced 2 """"ugly Americans"""" as guests recently. They seemed to be on holiday mainly to see what was wrong with Europe, and were not at all like other Airbnb guests we'd had in the past. It started out with them blaming us for not allowing them to arrive at 9am (our listed arrival time is after 3pm) accusing us of not including the information on our list, and got worse over time. They made complaints (some petty and one real complaint which we addressed immediately) to which we responded in person and by phone - and documented all our responses and actions with them via Airbnb mails, all on the Airbnb system. They would often report things to us - like the internet being out after a town-wide power outage - at 2.30am via text message. We acted immediately and handled even their petty issues and we even allowed them to bring in extra guests (this was a grave mistake as it turns out) who were not on their reservation. It would take me forever to explain all the things they complained about and how we attempted to appease them, but trust that we did take action on all their issues and they never once were with out any essential services. In the middle of their 3 week rental, they suddenly demanded a rolling 50% refund from us for any days they did not think they received 100% service, and when we refused this ridiculous open-ended agreement, pointing out that they had not thus far been without any services - (they described to us the agreement as them """"wanting to stay on our good side"""") they immediately that night wrote an e-mail to us on the Airbnb mail system claiming that this was """"official notice"""" of a leak in our toilet - inventing a problem (fake as it turns out) of a """"leak"""". They then phoned Airbnb in the USA (who do not take into account time zones at all - it is awful) who also wrote us an e-mail at something like 2am (no one called for this supposed emergency!!), telling us our customer had an issue that needed immediate attention and why were we not addressing the issue. We did not see either mail until early the next morning. We responded when we woke and saw the mails, told Airbnb that we were dealing with the customer on a regular basis as was evidenced on the Airbnb mail system and that for this new issue, the customer was now refusing to allow us to enter the premises to deal with the reported leak. The guests had sent a note demanding immediate resolution to the """"leak"""" but also said we were not to enter the apartment when they were not there. Asked for their earliest convenience, they said we could only enter the premises at 2pm. When we asked for the status of this """"leak"""" emergency as they'd written after midnight and it was now 7 hours later and we were concerned about the state of the property - we were sent a mobile phone photo of what appeared to be about a teaspoon of clear water between 2 tiles on the floor. By the time we were allowed into the apartment, the guests were gone and so was the non-existent """"leak"""" - which never reappeared. Without so much as a phone call to us, Airbnb changed the guest's reservation to have it end that day and took a week's remaining rental fees back from us which they had already paid to our account out of the next renters. Yet there is no accounting or invoice for this activity. They then allowed the guest to post a negative review saying there was raw sewage leaking in our apartment for 96 hours and it was a public health hazard, that we refused to call plumbers, and various other utter inventions and libel about our characters - all the lies were directly refuted by their own e-mails on Airbnb and by a video I took of the state of the apartment the minute they left it that day as well as a buliding manager who had visited during the day just prior to their claim of a leak. I spent then hours on the phone and writing e-mails to Airbnb support, sending documentation -- and I received a written note saying their negative review would be edited and it was - the lies were removed. So it didn't seem so bad, even though the refund to the guest stayed. But as it turns out - we were lied to by the customer service team - specifically by Jet in the """"Trip Experience"""" team - what a piece of work she is. They took the original review off the site for only 1 week. Interestingly, this coincided with us receiving 2 packages for the now departed """"guests"""" which we'd agreed previously to accept for them. Once we forwarded those packages on to the new address - they were allowed to re-edit the review. Apparently the bad review was taken down only to placate us - and once they re-edited their review, they simply posted even more lies than the first review - this time including new inventions. We were not told of the re- review by the automated Airbnb system that should say """"you received a review from guest xxx"""" with a link to it - we discovered it by accident while reviewing reservations. I was then bald-faced lied to 3 times that a supervisor would call us about it, and then I was hung up on when I called today saying only """"the decision was final"""" with me saying """"what decision are you speaking about"""" ?? What utter cretins of human beings. And then a supervisor finally did call back - to say that the original person - Jet - handling our case is the one who let the guest edit the review a 2nd time. Oh, and they were sorry we were not informed and that I was hung up on. Oh and he did have the name of her supervisor - Aislin. However, there was no way for me to send either one of them a mail directly or call them - and there is apparently no one above them (I am certain their is but they will not tell you). Airbnb's mails when we first complained about the bad review said they believe in """"free speech"""" and this is why they allow this. They refused to address even once in writing the proof of libel shown by the e-mails the customer wrote during the complaints compared to the utter inventions in the review that do not match the e-mails - they claimed we forced them to use the town's public toilets for 96 hours and they were """"forced"""" to leave because the apartment was a public health hazard on the review. They even allow the guest to describe our apartment as being in a basement, when it is visibly completely above ground in all the photos and in a video I then sent in. The review was pure libel, utterly designed to drive business away - no questions about it. All the proof was available. The customer service are absolutely horrid. I just wanted to warn other hosts to be aware that Airbnb has disingenuous, lying customer service reps, and on top of it - Airbnb controls fully your ability to do anything with reservations if a guest complains - including if the guest has lied and you can prove they are lying. And they do not care about libel on their website. They control all the money - so unless every single thing will always go perfectly for you, you will eventually be screwed by them even if they are violating the contracts and rental laws in your country by doing so with their illegal terms and conditions. They will not tell you names of anyone you are dealing with, you have no direct e-mail to them, no phone numbers except the general help line - the wait is between 15-30 minutes to speak to anyone (and we called many times). Also the customer service reps will first say there are """"no supervisors"""" - so when you want to escalate something there is no way to do it - you are stuck with whomever you get and they will not speak to you about WHY a decision was made. All our actions fit their host help page for what to do if a customer complains and yet we were punished by them anyhow. We had customer service reps pretend to be nice to us and then they do the exact opposite of what they claimed they would do within minutes of exiting the phone call. It was horrible horrible horrible to deal with them - a huge waste of time and energy. They have no souls. They follow no laws but their own corporate internal and totally secret policies. There is some team called the """"Trip Experience"""" team - but you will never be able to talk to them directly - they simply make whatever decision they want to make and call it """"mediation"""" even though they never spoke with us even once - it is a dictatorship., not mediation by any stretch of the imagination. And in our case despite having an open """"ticket"""" no one will reply to us to address the proof of libel we sent citing various lines of the review which have e-mails on the Airbnb system or video that proved it could not possibly have happened as the guests stated. We won't get it in writing because they know what they are doing is illegal. I also had asked for invoices to show the money that was taken from the altered contract for a reservation - a negative invoice showing the amount removed and refunded to the guest - for my accounting - and I was told in writing that they could not do """"custom invoices"""". They went in and electronically CHANGED the paid reservation (contract) between ourselves and the guest after the guest was at our property - and there is no invoice trail of the money except a series of e-mails from various customer support people. No invoices, no explanation etc.. All e-mails are from one address - but you never know who will reply to you (or indeed if anyone will reply). So be very very very cautious if you use Airbnb to do any reservations. They are not like other services where you get to control your rental and even though they control the purse-strings - they are not accountable or contactable. In short, they are crooks. Because they re-housed the guests in another accommodation from their site, they made money anyhow, so they did not care. Customer Service lie like rugs so be cautious in believing what they say EVEN if you have it in writing - we have a letter saying that the review was being taken down, and then it went back up and the beatch never ever ever wrote to us to tell us - she knew she'd manipulated us and lied to us. Karma will get this company eventually. Airbnb customer service took their side over the host's side, despite our good reviews and good history for 2 years on their site and the guest being new to the site. And I've since read reports from other hosts with similar stories to ours, having Airbnb lie to them, not give them money, handle guest issues poorly -- so I know this is their way of doing business - hosts are a dime a dozen apparently. They only care about the money they make and as long as enough people host with them, they keep raking it in as they take fees from both the guest and the host. We are out not only the rental fees we lost (frankly we were happy to have the jerks out) but also we decided to now leave the site rather than put up with a site that will not remove provable libel. So we are losing bookings because we'd actually gotten all our bookings from them last year, and stupidly cancelled our other ads as they'd seemed redundant. Exercise extreme caution with this site and realise you have no control over your rentals at all if you use them, and no recourse if someone gives you a review that contains per se Libel where you have proof they are lying, they will publish it anyhow and tell you """"the decision is final, I need to disengage from this conversation now"""".""",181,System Failure -- Airbnb,Functional Failure -- Airbnb,,,TRUE,TRUE,,

"""I have had my Sunriver, Oregon vacation rental on Airbnb for a couple years. A month or so ago, I wondered why my bookings (and even inquiries) had dropped off: It turns out that Airbnb had """"delisted"""" my rental because they said that I wasn't responding to guest inquiries. In fact, while Airbnb may have been transmitting those inquiries, they were being filtered by my Yahoo email account (not just as """"spam"""" but entirely so -- that is, the emails weren't even appearing in my """"spam"""" folder). I followed Airbnb's guidance on this (adding their email addresses to my Yahoo contact), but the problem persisted. None of their emails was getting through to my Yahoo account. It was LITERALLY impossible to reach a real, live customer service person to try to obtain assistance and fix this issue. Finally, in frustration I cancelled my account. I did so without considering that I had one pending reservation that might be affected. When I cancelled my account, everything disappeared. Before that rental was scheduled to occur, I contacted Airbnb (having found a 415 area-code telephone number ELSEWHERE on the internet -- that is, not even on their own website). The man whom I reached gave me virtually no information: I told him that I was concerned that this renter would be angry or upset and confirmed that I would honor the reservation, but he advised me that the renter had been informed that the rental had been cancelled. He offered no reassurance that this was professionally handled, until I posed that very question: """"Was she told of the cancellation and that I'd still honor it, despite my canceling my Airbnb account?""""

After learning of this, Airbnb locked me out of the review process (though I probably would not have left one), I guess presuming that I would write a poor one. Of course, this explains how a shabby apartment has only good reviews. The host was in New York, so there was no hope of working out problems. At the second apartment, where we stayed a week in a 3-bedroom apartment and using only two bedrooms, the owner showed up at the door several times unannounced.

"""Not sure about others but I've been bombarded by AirBnB propoganda (subway, tv, online, etc.), which seems largely superficial and highly suspect. I understand from ubiquitous subway adverts, for example, that NY agrees that AirBnB is good for New Yorkers. Really? Well, this New Yorker respectfully disagrees. I'm a long time NYC resident (>15 years) and truly love living here: I support local business here; I employ people here; I own local businesses here; I own property here; and I pay property and income taxes here. AirBnB: Please let New Yorkers know what investments you are making in NYC to improve our neighborhoods (and I'm not referring to your self-serving PR efforts such as sponsoring the NYC marathon); how many people do you employ here (and I'm not referring to lawyers and lobbyists); and, with reference to the $$ amounts you are extracting from NYC, please advise on % of your income and $ amount that you are paying in taxes to support NYC and its vibrant neighborhoods. Answers to these and related questions, I believe, will help us understand your true intent and interests. No, New Yorkers do not agree. AirBnB is unfairly extracting significant value from NYC without sharing in the responsibilities of what makes NYC great and has not shown a willingness to invest in NYC to make it even greater. So, no, we do not agree. AirBnB is NOT good for New Yorkers. """,192,Informational Failure -- Airbnb,,,,TRUE,,,
"""I have used airbnb before and it was fine though in some instances, the privacy can be a bit of an issue. But this last experience is leaving a bitter taste in my mouth... I should have stick to Booking.com and Agoda.com. This is what happened: Based on the reviews, I contacted Max and have made a booking for a stay in January 2015 for Phuket.- I paid on 30/06/14 and had to cancel on 08/07/14 so that I do not disappoint my parents who want to be with me for my birthday as they live overseas and I see them once every 2 years. My parents wanted to make it a surprise but they had to tell me about it. I sincerely did not see the strict policy for cancellation but wen I contacted the host, Max... he refused to give me a full refund or even a full refund less one night fees for the inconvenience. He said to me that he would not refund because he potentially lost clients in that 7 days...Really? Max has no proof of that but wants to keep $197 in his pocket for a reservation that is made for 7 months ahead in Phuket, which will get booked quickly anyway. We are talking 7 months ahead... this is highway robbery... People just trying to rip you off as much as they can. To make things worse, the man has got a great profile but when you deal with him, completety opposite... no compassion, no understanding but pure selfishness, that's what comes across anyway in this case... More people should be aware of this situation as I do not want anyone to go through this like I do. This is a matter where Airbnb should intervene and act as a mediator but still waiting for this one. Their answer: policies are to protect the community... ripping people off is no protection.

"I have plenty of experience with booking online, but never experienced a lack of privacy as Airbnb. The only thing they don't require is stripping before your webcam.

They do not tell you in advance, but just request it step by step. I went a long way, much further than I usually do, but quite in the end.

"Today I started my day by finding a very nice looking property to rent in LA on Airbnb. I do a considerable amount of shopping online including travel and this one proceeded as usual - initially. So they take my dates and all my credit card details and then up pops a little line saying they need to verify me before they can confirm my booking. No mention of any of this at the outset by the way. So what exactly does verifying entail? Practically everything but my inside leg measurement it would appear. So they start with offline id. I am given 3 choices - passport, driving license or another id. I take photographs of my driving license once and scan it, not accepted, again and not accepted and again and not accepted. Feeling somewhat irritable I make an attempt at scanning my passport. Two attempts at that and no mention it has been successful but they move on to online id verification. At this point I am asked to link to either my Facebook, LinkedIn or Google accounts. While it may seem unbelievable to most the population I have absolutely no desire (let alone time!) for the first two but I do have a Google account so at that point I attempt to link that account. I then get a response saying that my Google account does not give enough information about me! At this point they ask that I make a 30 second video of myself giving my name and location! You have got to be kidding me. There would be less security required to get into the White House! And hang on a minute what exactly does this ridiculous request for a video give them? I email them and ask exactly that question. The response I get is that both hosts and guests can get a lot from the verification process but don't worry we won't share your video with anyone. So let me get this straight you want me to spend my time recording a video which will be tremendously useful to the person I am attempting to rent from and yet they are not going to see the video? I myself own a property I rent out through vrbo. Not in a million years would I want to put potential guest through these hoops. Oh and let me add whilst all this was going on they needed my phone number verified which involved them texting me and me then having to fill in the number they texted me and my email verified which required the same thing. By mid afternoon I have got precisely nowhere with my attempt to rent a property in LA from the princely sum of $297 which they have been quite happy to already request from my credit card! Last time I shopped ANYWHERE and often for considerably larger sums of money nobody requested I record a video of myself before they accepted the transaction! Imagine Pottery Barn saying before you buying this bedding would you mind just filming yourself and emailing it to us! I was beyond angry. Mostly because of the hours wasted with this quite ludicrous process which I was NOT told about before I started browsing their properties. If I had I would have quit immediately as I consider this a huge invasion of my privacy. And even at the end of the hours wasted I am totally unclear as to why, in addition to a scanned passport, scanned driving license,confirmed email address and telephone number, they wish for a video which they blithely instruct me to take on my smartphone and upload. And of course they would love me to give as much personal information as I can about myself on their profile page! Yea I bet they would! Social networking at its finest and lots of lovely information they can sell on! So I eventually told them to stick it and I would go back to vrbo and flipkey. I seriously hope the guests who are attempting to rent their properties out on airbnb know exactly what is expected of their potential guests before they have a hope of renting a property. And what about the huge market they are missing of more senior folk who don't have FB accounts or a smartphone to take a video on. I am very suspicious of the motives of this company and I would give zero stars if I could.",197,System Failure -- Airbnb,,,,TRUE,,,
