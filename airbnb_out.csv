0,Al,GB,5 reviews,"Thursday, March 3, 2022, 03:58:42 AM",1,GUESTS BEWARE,"GUESTS BEWARE, if you have any problems don’t expect Airbnb to help you - Airbnb have taken no action in response to my serious (and proven in writing) allegations against a host. They are allowing a proven conman to continue operating on their platform, and not taking steps to protect future guests from him or other unscrupulous hosts who choose to abuse Airbnb community standards, knowing they can get away with it. It’s totally irresponsible of the company to allow this man to continue hosting on the platform, and also to not take action when a community member repeatedly breaches Airbnb’s own standards. Why have the standards if you won’t enforce them? Furthermore it would only take a small amendment to their policy (to withhold money from hosts when there is any kind of change or query outstanding on the booking) to much improve the service for future guests. I have already repeatedly contacted customer services, the CEO & the BBB, but Airbnb refuse to address any of the issues. Absolutely terrible service!"
1,Anne,GB,12 reviews,"Wednesday, March 2, 2022, 05:08:22 PM",1,It's all good until it's not!,I've used Airbnb on a few occasions and always been happy however on this occasion due to storm Eunice and advice not to travel we were forced to cancel. This is where we ran into problems as host did not reply through Airbnb. The customer service is A JOKE passed around from one person to another and told it is the host's decision whether or not to cancel and if no response then automatically lose your money. Literally there is no policing of their site. Fortunately I managed to contact the host through a different means (Airbnb still saying unable to) and they immediately agreed to refund. Airbnb refused to accept the hosts emails as proof he was refunding as they 'could not be verified' fortunately he had by now released the money through Airbnb. Laughably their 'customer service' were still refusing to help me with passive aggressive emails even after I had been notified my money had been refunded.. basically you are better booking directly with your accomodation and giving these scammers a wide berth
2,Charlene Willey,GB,8 reviews,"Wednesday, March 2, 2022, 03:47:08 PM",1,Terrible customer service they just…,"Terrible customer service they just don't do anything and the online chat is useless. You just get passed on to someone who is suppose to have experience to help, Must be a imaginary person because 3 times now this person never got back to me I have 3 chats with no resolve they just go dead on you. What's the point of Air bnb exactly just a useless middleman that dies jack S nothing. Guest get no help, I had a hostile host and left 2 days early a loss to me but I don't think I will get any help."
3,Oliver Stanley,GB,6 reviews,"Wednesday, March 2, 2022, 12:52:58 PM",1,Wont post negative reviews,"This company does not post negative reviews about their hosts. I genuinely have written two thoughtful reviews about two stays I had in London and they contained negative aswell as positive aspects to the accommodation that I thought would be helpful to future guests.However, Airbnb refuses to post them. I have spoken with their support team at length, and they cannot tell me why they wont post them just that they dont fit their requirements. Utterly ridiculous and bad practice. The whole point of having a ratings system is the paying customer can decide if they want to stay in a place or not. I wont be using Airbnb again there are loads of other websites that use a fair rating system."

I paid 360 for the place and then end up getting a email saying they cannot accommodate me! Sends me the refund but won’t process until 15 days later! Why even let me pay if it was going to reject me what an awful experience my birthday is a few days away and I’m 360 out of pocket ! I’ll be broke on my birthday how depressing. Don’t book through these people they didn’t even care that their website did this absolutely disgusting 🤮
5,The Gifted UK Psychic,GB,1 review,"Tuesday, March 1, 2022, 05:57:49 AM",1,Steer Clear! You will be robbed,"Absolute scam as in other reviews here. We entered a cockroach infested Air b n b in Mount St,Coogee, NSW Australia January 2022 and lost £1400 because it was filthy. We left and tried for refunds for 4 wks from vile Host Margaret and also Air b n b. They even remove reviews unless they are glowing 4 or 5 star reviews. Host then tried to sublet our booking out on local facebook group. Such greed!! Book a hotel. AIR B N B IS A SCAM"
6,Terry Page,GB,4 reviews,"Tuesday, March 1, 2022, 04:25:41 AM",1,They made me and my family vulnerable!,"We booked a 3 bedroom apartment near to Disneyland for my 4 year old nephews birthday. We received instructions regarding access to the property days before and even up until the day before. When we arrived at 1am, the code didn’t work. We contacted the owner who eventually told us that they no longer had access to the property and offered a one bed room apartment 14 minutes away instead.We reported it to Airbnb and explained we had a 4 year old completely homeless at now 2am at zero degrees! They didn’t care.The said they would refund the trip and pay for the hotel. They didn’t.I can never take the risk of booking with Airbnb again because when it all went wrong. They left me and my family very vulnerable!"

If you run into trouble as a customer they will leave you hanging with no help. I was left with kids waiting for my picture approval!!! With no accommodation !!! Had three agents and manager later email with no help or solution !!!Make sure you don’t run into troubles before booking as they won’t help you with anything.Terrible and worst customer service ever!
8,Katie Bean,US,1 review,"Monday, February 28, 2022, 11:34:43 PM",1,I never even found it - AirBnB didn't care.,"I have used AirBnB several times and have always been pleasantly surprised. From the quirky stays to the lavish unexpected, I have always been happy with my experiences - until now. I booked a place in Dallas for two nights that I NEVER found. I tried reaching out to the host and the co-host with no response. I called AirBnB for help, and they were not helpful either. It was late at night, in a dilapidated part of town, nothing was marked, and the check in direction sent to me by the host directed me to parking nowhere near where the building supposedly was (and did not match the listing). I tried reaching out to host and cohost for about 30 min with no response before I contacted support. They said I had to wait for a response from the host. The host finally contacted me almost 2 hours later with a response to my message of ""I can't find it"" with ""the address is listed."" I received nothing from the cohost until the next day and she never responded again when I told her I never found it. I contacted AirBnB again for a refund, and I was told I wasn't eligible for one. It didn't matter that I never found the place, had no helpful responses from the host(s), nor that the check-in directions did not match the listing. I contacted them repeatedly for a refund and was told ""no"" every time. According to them, they can find it on Google maps so that is good enough. They ignored everything else about the stay and host(s). All the good experiences I have had with AirBnB are now completely over-shadowed by this experience. I don't want to give any more money to a company that doesn't care about people enough to listen to them, and I won't."
9,Lesley Group Leader,GB,2 reviews,"Monday, February 28, 2022, 10:44:04 PM",1,Dreadful experience,Dreadful experience. my 'superhost' cancelled my reservation after he confirmed availability and I had booked flights. I contacted airbnb customer service via chat line. They answered then told me they were passing me to another members of team who would be able to help me. 15 minutes later I had heard nothing. I gave up.
10,Leanne T,GB,2 reviews,"Monday, February 28, 2022, 08:38:56 PM",1,Ridiculous refund policy,"I had a weekend away booked which I had paid £200 for. I had to cancel this due to unfortunate circumstances and provided 3 months notice. The refund policy is absolutely ridiculous. I was unable to get any refund back, even though I cancelled in plenty of time and they have probably been able to resell the slot! To move the dates it was going to cost an additional £200 and I already had £200 left to pay.Even through the resolution centre I was unable to get my money back.I will never use air bnb again."
11,Michelle Fitzgerald-Baird,GB,2 reviews,"Monday, February 28, 2022, 07:06:55 PM",1,Booked a chalet in Moleson Sur…,"Booked a chalet in Moleson Sur Gruyeres, Switzerland for our ski trip through airbnb. We had been confirmed through both our airline company & the Swiss embassy that we were good to travel to Switzerland then found out 2 days prior to our trip that this in fact was not the case due to changing covid regulation policies for entry requirements. We then contacted the host who didn't bother to reply so we contacted airbnb who didn't reply for 2 days. We lost all our money & even when we asked could we move our trip forward then 3 weeks to a date when the accommodation was free again (which was £900 less but we were willing to take the hit of the £900 regardless), they wouldn't oblige. Terrible company. Daylight robbery. We've been lied to on 3 separate occasions regarding the entry requirements, had our 4 year old built up looking forward to her first ever ski holiday only to be let down and now to top it off we've had almost £2,000 taken for accommodation we couldn't use & the host wouldn't even oblige to try & help accommodate in any way, shape or form. Will never, ever deal with this company again."
12,Sarah,GB,1 review,"Monday, February 28, 2022, 05:36:37 PM",1,Awful,Booked a place far in advance to get a cheap cost and then months later the host cancelled unexpectedly. Well we've paid for flights and made plans now so we booked another place for almost twice the amount and once it was confirmed the host messaged us with extra off the books charges. Airbnb say that this is the host's right to do this and won't refund us. It's literally a scam! Honestly stay far far away from Airbnb just book a hotel the normal way!
13,Darius Sakalauskas,GB,1 review,"Monday, February 28, 2022, 12:45:01 PM",1,Awful dealing with stressful situation,"We had a really nightmare experience with airbnb apartment just a day before our wedding day. After the initial check-in, they key was left in the place it was found (as there was more people staying together, and we could not exchange the key directly), and later when we arrived, we found out that there was another guy in the apartment, all drunk, vomited all over the place and on himself. As you can understand, there was a lot of stress as it was just a day before our wedding. We asked the police and ambulance to come, and eventually found out that the guy was living next door and mixed up the keys. We accept that hovewer weird, this situation can happen. We were most angry on how the apartment manager and airbnb acted: apartment manager, who most probably rented the place to this other guy as well (we were not sure about the actual situation), did not even apologize for the situation as we had to deal with everything. She offered to cancel the reservartion (that would only return small portion of the amount we paid). So we called the airbnb - naturally they said that they will investigate the situation. During their investigation the reservation was cancelled by the apartment manager (perhaps with the ask of airbnb) so at least they returned what we paid, and what was the most ridiculous - offered 10% on top, even though we had to endure so much stress, deal with police, rebook another place for a much higher price. Well we are happy that we did so as airbnb experience was horrible. Seeing all other comment and reviews, really thinking of never using it again. Other platforms sure would have dealt with this situation much better. Everything happend in Vilnius, Lithuania on the 11th of February."

15,Carla A,US,1 review,"Saturday, February 26, 2022, 08:02:28 PM",1,Be careful: May be left high and dry in a pinch,"We have had several smooth situations with airbnb, but we definitely learned after our last experience, that we will be left high and dry if things don't go right and we need help.We found ourselves in airports for two days and a night with our kids, and when learning all hotels were full in the middle of it, decided to try airbnb. After paying for a rental car by phone from our gate, we booked the only home we could find available on airbnb, and made our way across the airport and outside to the car rentals. The host communication was above and beyond the entire time we were updating her on our circumstances and making our decision to stay, and bent several policies for us in order to allow us to book in the middle of the night. Upon getting to the car rental counter, however, we were told that because of all the canceled flights and weather, every company had NO cars available - including ours - no buses were running that time of night, and uber was going to charge $400.Less than an hour after we pressed ""book"" on the app, I let our host know that we were unable to get to the property and had to cancel. However - somehow now that they had the $700 that we paid to use the house for 10 hours, no policy bending happened!I would have hoped that by getting airbnb involved, airbnb would act as a middle man to help us work with the homeowner and advise each side in order to come to an agreeable compromise. But the message was - too bad. The homeowner doesn't want to give you your money back.So we slept on the cold airport floor with our kids that night, and the house cleaners had a real easy day the next morning at the house we paid for with their $300 cleaning fee.Each time as an airbnb guest we always go above and beyond with our communication and our care of the properties we rent. It's disappointing that airbnb wasn't there to help us when we faced a really big problem as we encountered several obstacles during this event, including the entire month after getting home that we spent communicating around it. The added financial strain of the $700 to our trip because of the issue with airbnb was a big one, and we are definitely highly disappointed with the outcome. After this experience, we won't be as trusting of the goodwill of homeowners toward their guests, or of airbnb's ability to step in and help when it comes to gray areas that aren't covered by general policy, where it seems guests are only being treated as commodities rather than human beings."
16,Mauro Provato,GR,3 reviews,"Saturday, February 26, 2022, 04:00:58 PM",1,Booking site that encourages scammers,"We had an incident with an Airbnb customer in one of our luxury villas where during their stay he insulted the manager, the owner and the cleaning lady because the cleaning lady accidentally entered the villa to clean without his consent.  For the same reason, he also hit the cleaning lady.  Airbnb not only did not support us on this issue when we mentioned it to them but also took the customer's side. In addition, we noticed that the information he showed us on the first day of his arrival was not true. We removed our listings and accounts from Airbnb after this incident and will never work with this company again."

18,Jenna H,US,3 reviews,"Friday, February 25, 2022, 07:43:59 AM",1,Biased and discriminatory,"Yet another company that cares more about what a person looks like in paper than in real life. They’d rather offer services to a recent violent misdemeanor offender than a non-violent felon that’s been living a law-abiding lifestyle for years. Companies that discriminate against a person’s past are not encouraging to the continuation of a law abiding life, but traps those in a cycle with no other option."

20,So Cal,US,1 review,"Thursday, February 24, 2022, 05:06:29 PM",1,Airbnb altered my public review,"I left a truthful review for a very bad property that was dirty and was in a dangerous neighborhood . Only one line of my review was publish for the public viewing, the rest of my review was put into personal. They said I must have done that. I entered one review. Not 2, I didn't write one for personal and one for public. They are telling me they don't edit people's reviews they only remove reviews that don't follow guidelines. They did edit/altered mine and say nothing can be done now that 15 days are up."

The hosts are not professionals so if your rental is not up to your standards, since the platform offers none, you are screwed. They will not help you and telling your host only results in a worse stay if your stuck. Then since you complained, the host will trash you with a review. terrible customer support, had to escalate to Presidents office for help and online chat takes hours to get a reply. Not a fan and will avoid in the future. You have more recourse hotels."

They have even stopped asking for information they already have. The staff at Airbnb all the way up to their CEO are the most ignorant on the planet.

25,C Christian,GB,2 reviews,"Tuesday, February 22, 2022, 02:18:00 PM",1,Will never use Airbnb again,I used the service for the first time in February when it was quite cold outside. The host will leave the heat off during the day and the place was quite cold upon my return in the evening. I left and notified Airbnb within their 24h policy but did not get the rest of my stay refunded - being cold it was not a reason for Jojen - the customer support person to actually look into this.
26,CJ,US,1 review,"Monday, February 21, 2022, 09:15:14 PM",1,Multiple policy violations,"I am very concerned about Airbnb policies and how they suppressed our friend’s review of our recent stay on January 12-14, 2022. Property /52091039This listing violated many of your Airbnb policies; yet Airbnb has allowed this listing to remain falsely advertised without true and accurate reviews. 1.  I had to boil hot water in the stove two nights in a row to take a “bird bath “ because the owner neglected to send someone out to fix the hot water heater as promised. Additionally, it was a hazard for us to even try to light a pilot and attempt  figure out fixing the hot water heater to have a shower and clean properly, which leads me to my next point - enhanced Covid cleaning  protocol 2. Airbnb’s 5-step enhanced cleaning process was violated. There is no way the host could have the home properly cleaned, sanitized, and prepared between guests WITHOUT hot water. ( we screenshot a review that was up after our stay that also said there was no hot water)3. The bathrooms were not clean and the linen was and towels were old and disgusting 4. Airbnb allowed the host to bully our friends and accuse them of extortion, which is far from the truth. 5. False listing -This listing is advertised as a 3 bedroom 3 bath home. This is a 1 bedroom apartment condo downstairs and a 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment upstairs. This is not one home for a large group, but two apartments. I am very appalled at how Airbnb resolved this issue and we plan on seeking legal advice because your policy requires homes to have hot water and clean due to Covid. Additionally,  Airbnb is suppressing reviews because it wasn’t submitted because we were traveling and to get out of the dump Airbnb is allowing to be advertised and allowing host to falsely advertise and violate multiple policies. Additionally I called Airbnb with the issue on 1/13/22; however, my friend  wanted to handle it it with the host as Airbnb prefers so I hung up, which backfired. Airbnb policies don’t really protect guests. Please investigate this issue and hold your hosts accountable."
27,Lynda Lastinger,US,1 review,"Monday, February 21, 2022, 04:30:29 PM",1,If I could give airbnb a minus star I would,"If I could give airbnb a minus star I would. We made reservations 9 months in advance for a trip to Maine. The area we were to stay in is somewhat remote and reservations are difficult to come by. 6 days prior to our trip at 1:00am in the morning I get a notification that our reservations have been cancelled and we have been given a refund. No other explanation. I immediately called and was put on hold for over 1 hours and finally gave up at 2:30am. Called the next day and was told ""yes we see there is a problem but I cant take care of it. Some one will call you back shortly"". 6 hours later no one has called so I call again. I am told "" yes we see there is a problem and they are working on it. I will put you on a priority list and someone will call you shortly"". This is now two days later and I have yet to hear from anyone. What we have been able to gather is that I had two accounts with airbnb. They shared the same phone number but different email addresses. I was unaware of the two different accounts. I know know that one was very old and the email address associated with it was from 10 years previous. Airbnb can not merge a old account with a new account. So the system I guess was confused so It just cancelled out reservation. I can understand technical issues but the lack of communication and customer service is unacceptable. I will never use airbnb again. We were able to secure reservation through vbro thankfully and they will get my business from now on. Any one reading this I would encourage you to do the same. Do not support airbnb with your hard earned money."

29,Alex,GB,20 reviews,"Sunday, February 20, 2022, 04:28:48 AM",1,Airbnb + Sextant Apartments = Travel Scam. READ BEFORE YOU BOOK!,"1. Listing is fake. This is not the flat that you’ll get. In the photos they show a large, bright and airy flat with a table and 4 chairs. In reality, you’ll get a small, dark and crammed bunker with a bar-like table and 2 high chairs (not for kids). They do state in their terms and conditions that they may accomodate you in a similar flat and not the one in the photos, but they are abusing the term similar. This flat is nothing similar to the one in the photos. I don’t understand why Airbnb allows this travel scam and why they don’t check the accuracy of the listings, but I have taken steps to take Airbnb to the small claims court and recover my money. I’m pretty sure this is illegal in the EU.2. In the photos, you’ll see a bright flat with large windows. The real apartment has 2 small windows at the back of the building where you can only see the concrete fence and nearby building. You can’t even open the shades.3. They claim to clean to CDC standards and that their cleaning staff does such an amazing job. This one’s the best :)) The flat was filthy when we checked in and had to call them to send somebody to clean. They only came the next day and somehow managed to do a very poor job. When we came back to the room, the floor was not as dirty as before but still dusty, and they did not vacuum the carpet. We had to roll the carpet and put away because we were traveling with our 1-year old and he was crawling through the dust. Unhealthy, unsanitary and filthy, these are Sextant’s understanding of the CDC standards. Then we decided to clean ourselves and used the vacuum cleaner from the cleaning staff. This was an old, run-down $50 vacuum cleaner that was barely pulling any dust and that’s why the cleaning ladies did a poor job.4. You won’t be able to sleep due to the outside lights. They have 2 exterior lights, right outside the bedroom window. These are very strong and lighten up the entire room during the night. If you are a Navy Seal and can sleep in any conditions you’ll be good. If you’re like the rest of us, this is torture. You will literally sleep with the lights on as if it was daylight. I have attached photos of the bedroom5. The washing machine is not working. They claim to have a washer but that’s not working. I asked them to repair it and every time they say they are sorry and that they understand me and they forwarded my request to the responsible team. Somebody came in to repair it while we were away, and they started the washer with our clothes inside. They haven’t finished, probably due to the washer being completely broken, and left the clothes inside without telling us. After 2 days, we found our clothes were all wet and moldy. We’ve signaled this and got the same answer, nobody repaired the washer and nobody cared that we didn’t have any clothes for our baby that day.6. The apartment is incredibly noisy. Even though the flat is at the back of the building and not on the main street, we could literally hear all the cars passing on the main street. I don't even understand how this is possible. We could even tell which one is a small car, which one's a truck, and which one's a bus. I dread to think of the noise that can be heard from the flats directly positioned on the main street. The funniest of things, you'll even hear planes landing in Miami. And if that's not enough, the building right next to the flat uses a generator that makes a very annoying noise throughout the night.7. Sextant's apartment has ants and roaches. To be honest, that's not even a big deal compared to all others, but definitely worth mentioning.To summarize, in Sextant's apartments, you'll feel like sleeping on the street with ants and roaches and with the lights on. So good luck sleeping in these conditions. I will never book through Airbnb again. With their competitors, at least you see exactly what you’re renting."

The host texted us fairly early in the evening and seemed anxious about our check-in time. We agreed to arrive by 9.30pm and the host apologised for being a bit overzealous in their first message (it had had a certain tone!) and wished us a good evening. We arrived on time at the host's house by taxi - the taxi driver actually knew the place and the lady hosting, when we confirmed her name, so we knew it was the right place.We rang the bell.No-one answered.We knocked the door.No-one answered.We texted the host. She told us she was with her mother. who was end of life, and that her husband was there to let us in.We rang again, we knocked again - and again and again. We saw lights that were on go off upstairs. We wondered if this lady's husband might not be up for hosting this evening. We waited over half an hour, repeatedly ringing the bell and knocking. We were concerned the neighbours might come out about the noise. We texted the host again but we didn't get any reply. It was raining the whole time.When it was gone 10pm, we thought - grief, let's go back to the seafront and get a hotel. We tried to call a cab. None were available. This was one of the early weekends out of Covid when everyone had rushed to the coast. We were literally stranded in the rain. We started to walk back to the seafront, which was a 40 minute walk. About 15 minutes' down the road, we saw the golden arches - a 24 hour McDonalds. We thought it would be wiser to stop here and call up hotels rather than walk in the rain. We called all the hotels along the sea front. We explained the situation over and over again. No vacancies, anywhere. We tried neighbouring towns all around - nothing.We finally thought to contact Airbnb, after all, we had paid in full for our booking and hadn't been let in. We were only able to submit something via an online form.Now, we had a pretty crappy night under the strip lighting and with the constant dance music playing. We saw the clubbers come and go around 4am. The second day of our trip, we decided, was a write-off. What would we do about our train tickets? We'd bought the cheaper fixed-time return.Airbnb called us in the morning. The guy offered to refund out £11 taxi we'd taken to the host's house. They refunded our booking. Did we get compensation? Nope. Did we get to leave a review? No, because we hadn't stayed with the host.And then hours at the train station waiting a friendly train driver to let us go home on an earlier train....!"

I have to borrow a tractor from a friend to work with. These people bought some land on our driveway and brought some heavy equipment in to grade their land. They totally destroyed our driveway and left it for me to fix. It was destroyed so bad I worked on it for 2 days and finally got it patched up so we can get in and out to go places. The tractor is not big enough to fix the mess they left. The man that brought in the equipment told my wife and me he would fix it then wished us a MERRY CHRISTMAS next he loaded up his equipment and left. He did NOT fix anything. I sent airbnb an email about the mess they left. IT LANDED ON DEAF EARS AND EYES. The folks at airbnb only want to make money they do NOT care about the community around them. I'm a 66 year old disabled veteran and I just got out of the hospital only to come home to THEIR MESS. My next move is to speak to an attorney. This driveway is in Ellijay Ga. and is called Sumac, Ln. BEWARE of the people in your neighborhood they destroy you community.🐣"

We complained straight away and was directed to AIRBNB where we explained the situation and they would go back to the host. However, we spoke to the host and after a 3 hour delay of our holiday agreed that we would stay there that night at £20 and she would refund the balance.Where we were also, there was absolutely no hotels free of any rooms so we had to spend more time looking for somewhere to stay.I am still waiting.I have the proof in my AIRBNB account what was agreed and AIRBNB asked for my log in so they could review the messages. One clearly stating a refund would be made.I have contacted AIRBNB three times now and they offer no assistance at all, it's a complete disgrace and in the eyes of the law with confirmation of a refund why they will not act on it.It's now 8 months and my temper and patience is getting less and less and am tempted to go legal.I don't know why they get away with this treatment seeing as the host is not paid until 30 days after the booking incase of cancellation. I booked with AIRBNB so I expect a refund from them."

I have just lost my £2200 deposit  because AirB&B's strict refund policy is based on the total cost of the holiday not what you have actually paid.  Even with 3 months notice and covid causing issues, you get no refund, unlike BA and Hertz who refunded us immediately.  The host is also entitled to keep your money even if your weeks are rebooked, they are under no obligation to refund although some  decent hosts will.  Unless you can afford to lose any money you have paid, or are absolutely certain you won't need to cancel, find another company.  AirB&B aren't interested once they have your money."
36,Jaimie,US,1 review,"Thursday, February 17, 2022, 11:03:29 PM",1,Horrible Experience,"A host in Shawnee, CO who has a unit in the basement of her home made false claims in hopes to get money. I planned this trip for a friend's birthday but was unable to attend due to an illness. The trip was 1.22.22-1.23.22. The birthday girl and her boyfriend ended up going alone. The host waited to the very end of the 14 day time period to review the guests and claimed they did not follow the check out procedure. When I asked her what happened she claimed the unit was left with 3 bags of trash-all around the unit, sink full of dishes that weren't done, the chlorine floater to the hot tub was thrown into the dirt, the cap to the water feature was broken and the water feature was left on which ruined the jets to the reclining seat in the hot tub and that she was going to have to get it serviced and would be making a claim to Airbnb. When I spoke to my friend she mentioned she and her boyfriend never used the hot tub, never used dishes, and had maybe 1-3 pieces of trash in the trash cans. The host later said she would be happy to send me the text thread between her and her cleaning woman. The text thread stated the couch was stained, the curtain rod was bent, 3 bags of trash, dirty dishes, a bunch of stuff left in the shower, a blanket was missing, and there was grease down the drain. None of this was matching to her earlier claims. The shower in the unit also didn't have a shower rod. When I mentioned this and asked for a time stamp of the text thread she said she wasn't savvy with her phone. I continued to explain the steps on how to take a screenshot, just as she did with the text thread she sent. She then proceeded to tell me she would be happy to make sure she had the correct guests. I had to follow up the next day because she sent nothing after I confirmed I would like her to check her records and make sure. I was so surprised that she hadn't already checked on this important bit of information. After all the back and forth and speaking to Airbnb customer service, she admitted she had the wrong guests and that it was the people that stayed after who trashed her place. I was no longer able to review this host because it was at the end of the 14 day period. I also responded to the host's review before I knew of all the false claims she was making. I proceeded to contact Airbnb to get assistance with my review and asked if I could edit it or leave one myself. I explained this host was in my experience trying to scam us for money and I wanted to make sure she did not do it to anyone else and to make other guests aware. I was told I could no longer edit my response to her review nor leave a review myself. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor to discuss this as well as report this host but was told there was no capability to transfer and that a supervisor would be in touch. I called again the next day and was told it would take 24-48 hours. I emailed back and forth after that with several techs but never got to speak to a supervisor. I then got a message from the supervisor on 2.11.22 telling me I could write a response to the review that the host left. I emailed back and explained I had already done so before I knew what the host was trying to pull and that what I wanted to do was report this host and that I would appreciate a call back from her or her supervisor. On 2.12.22 she messaged and told me her tools were not working but that she would call back on Tuesday 2.15.22.Today is 2.17.22 and I have not heard back. I messaged her again today asking for a call back as this was important and what the host in Shawnee, CO is doing is not acceptable. The fact that in 2022 there is no way to be transferred to a supervisor nor to edit a review or leave a review after 14 days is beyond me. Airbnb's customer service  is horrible and no one is willing to do what's right to help and if they claim they do want to help you, make sure you have several months or longer to get assistance. Hopefully I can get the assistance I need to report this host and ensure it is not happening to other guests."

There was a price issue on one of my properties showing a dramatic discount for anyone renting 30 days or more, that i did not set up. I then contact the host customer service to get it fixed. As we work through this issue a guest books an entire month - I immediately message them that the total Rental price would be approx 5x higher since the discount was wrong. The guest subsequently cancels saying that they would prefer a more affordable stay which I totally understand. After this I get a call at night from the Host customer service to CHECK that I did not cancel the reservation myself (super hosts who cancel a guest once lose their status so they are on top of that like hawks). This added to the obsequious and condescending tone of their India - based CS ( they always apologize for being out of the office when the original message is sent, and always call after 7 PM at night with profuse excuses every time for such a late call)  made me want to find a CS manager to talk to. The CS rep did not believe the guest canceled, nor had the tools to check that themselves, even though I had a system email proving this cancellation from the guest.  I had to argue and CONVINCE THEM i did not cancel the booking, or I would have been penalized. This is plain unacceptable.  Remember that hosts are the cash cows of Airbnb and have absolutely no rights whatsoever."

Air bnb asked for my identity and I sent them various photos of my passport and of myself by web cam. Without giving any concrete reasons and only after about 15 hours I was rejected. In the meantime and BEFORE they ‘checked’ my identity without so-called confirmation they had already debited my account and now I have to wait 15 business days to get my money back. They should have checked my identity in the first place before debiting my account. Is this not obvious? I think this is a very unprofessional behaviour and certainly not a way to build up potential customers’ relationships. For me they are done.

Airbnb cancelation policy was if you cancel, after 48 hours, you would only receive 50% minus a service fee.  They canceled the reservation without my permission.  I had asked to be reimbursed half again as much as I paid (realizing that I wouldn't get it) but they had been cycling me for a week with no satisfactory result.  I will also be providing a negative review of Downeast Rentals as well.  To make this worse.  I experienced something similar with VRBO.

Whilst the host was supportive, the CS tried to just sort of help and find soemthing else by telling me to look myself and writing to hosts. They didn't wanna get involved really. So that it looks like all was my choice. They refunded my monies, which didn't come straight away into my account  of course and I had to pay again. Promised a credit, which  came days later.. Then they mamaged to change me by convincing another host,who didn't want to take me or really had other guests coming over,which is bs because he took me at the end. Which was great and all, but then another issue came up again and this kicked off another endless talks with CS team. At the end the resolution team highest adviser was able to do soemthing logical about it all. It is senseless to talk to the CS team cuz they just don't care and can't do much. The resolution advisor was the first contact who really had the right level of solving the issue, the right level of business support and conversation handling. The rest before is simply nothing more than senseless.it sounds harsh, but unfortunately it is what it is. They literally just are trying to get though their shift.

69,AW Hart,CA,1 review,"Saturday, February 5, 2022, 02:14:30 PM",1,Airbnb… Careful what you ask.,"Airbnb…. I have never used the service but found myself in a situation of needing to rent for my family during the remaining winter months while we sold or home and prepare to build. When I asked the host a QUESTION around policies, she took it upon herself to CANCEL my reservation leaving my husband, myself, my 4 year old daughter and two animals in the dead of winter homeless. I am disgusted that this type of behaviour is allowed with Airbnb with no repercussion. Make sure when you are booking, you ask no questions as it will jeopardize your reservation and Airbnb will let it slide. This was for a townhouse in Sarnia Ontario called Nestled Townhouse, which wasn’t even in the best area of the city. The women even made reference to wishing me well in search of a new place for my family! I received a full refund however what I had paid her was $2870 for one month! I wasn’t sure what type of comment this was but my budget had nothing to do with the question. The question was regarding their policies to cancel as what I was told prior to booking was not what was indicated on my reservation which caused my great concern of being trapped and mislead. The host even agreed as that was not their policy."

I have informed them also of the antisocial behaviour and noise that goes well beyond 11pm and they have done nothing! I even have proof of noise abatement notices being served many times over but still nothing! Airbnb are as greedy as the unscrupulous landlords who rent out properties with no care for the community that they reside within! They state that landlords who rent beyond 90 days in Westminster have to show proof of planning permission but Ive told them the host doesn't have permission and they have done nothing! Law breaking greedy company disgusting!

This is my mobile phone number!! why would i try another number for trip updates and why can your app not accept that number in the first place?So now i am stopped from booking my place with a stupid app that does not accept numbers. So I contact support on the app and they take forever to respond, I thought he was cooking his dinner or something he took that long!! I am then told this has been escalated to an ambassador who will ring me.(Ambassador of what?)Well, he does not ring me and his name is MARK E. He tells me that he will ring me at some point.So he rings Me 3 hours later and I am told this is something he has to pass on to the tech team!!What a joke.In the meantime, I will not know when the tech team will sort this out!!A multi-million-pound company who are having app problems!! Say what!!!!So I have had contact with two people and none of them have done anything, what is this company playing at.Take a leaf out of Amazon's customer support and sort out the problem immediately.By the time this problem is addressed, I will have probably lost the booking.What a joke and I don't think I will use this company again.

Be very careful!You accept terms which effectively fail to protect you as a customer unless you report any issues through their communication channels with a host. I stayed at an Air Bnb that had an air bed as the only bed provided. Furthermore, the air bed had holes in it and I had to get up in the middle of the night to re-inflate it. Despite this being against Air BnB's own policies, they would not give me a partial refund.In addition to this poor experience, the host was allowed to give me a negative review simply because I asked for a refund, for a perfectly valid reason. If you stayed in a hotel and they couldn't provide you with a bed, I think you would be liable to at least a partial refund.Due to Air Bnb not wanting to help with the situation because I spoke to the host in person, not through the app. They refused to get involved, even though I had photographic evidence from my stay. I went through my credit card company for a charge back but that was refused because of the outrageous terms I had unknowingly agreed to.Following this experience I have deleted my account."
75,Sarah,GB,3 reviews,"Wednesday, February 2, 2022, 07:40:30 PM",1,Zero guest rights,"I rented a flat in sky garden through Airbnb for 6 months contract, and as soon as I entered the property I was shocked by what I saw, the landlord left his boxers, socks and clothes hanging in the middle of the living room, he had sealed the drawers in the bathroom, put a lock on the wardrobe and filled every single space in the apartment with his stuff, 5 luggage spread all around the apartment, having to constantly walk over them, a fridge full expired food, and a stinky and mouldy dish-washer (pictures and videos were all provided to Airbnb). I contacted the landlord immediately to raise the issue and he said he won't do anything about it as it would be too much hassle for him. Later, I spoke to him letting him know that I wanted to cancel the reservation and get my refund for the rest of the booking, he said that Airbnb wouldn’t allow him even if he wanted to, so I called Airbnb to make sure and they told me that refunds are up to the host’s discretion, after explaining that to the host, he advised me “please initiate the cancellation in order for Airbnb to commence a refund procedure according to the regulations”, for which I did, but then he refused to issue the refund. I raised the issue to Airbnb, and they refused to help me as they said the landlord is the only one who can issue the refund, basically telling me that despite him providing a place unsuitable to live especially for a long stay, completely breaking the rules of any decent living, he will get away with it and keep more than £2000! This is absurd, a cheap hotel provides better conditions than Airbnb and the host, how am I supposed to stay in a messy, dirty place full of luggage for 6 months? this is not a small amount of money, I cannot afford to lose it, especially since I was more than happy to stay there for the 6 months, all I asked was more space as I could manage with everything else, but he refused. what am I supposed to do?

79,George,US,1 review,"Sunday, January 30, 2022, 01:49:01 PM",1,Airbnb Renters Beware: Looks like revenues from rentals may be more important than protecting guests!,"Airbnb says they, “…take cancellations seriously as this may really disrupt our guests plans”. They state that they will post an auto review to let potential guests know that a host canceled a reservation (You are not allowed to leave a review if the host cancels before your stay!). However, in my case they did not post an auto review after a host canceled my seasonal ski rental just before the 2021/22 season was about to start.  I did not see an auto review after a few days so I asked Airbnb support why?  They answered “We’ve given your case and its details careful consideration and we determined that this case will be closed….We understand that this might not be what you’d hoped for, but we came to this outcome because there's nothing that we can further do anymore about the automatic review of the host.”Mad as Hell, I fired back “Unacceptable! I do not think the auto review ever went up. Even if it did, it's only been a week since my reservation was canceled, why would you take it down at all? It should stay up at least as long as any other reviews so people can read not only what other guests have to say about their stays and interactions with the host, but also so they can see that he canceled a reservation, possibly multiple times. If you're taking auto reviews down, or not putting them up at all, then it's possible that this host, and others, have canceled multiple times and potential guests have no idea!You say that protecting the community is very important to you. This certainly doesn't look like it is! It looks like revenues from hosts are more important”Here’s why you should be concerned about renting on Airbnb If Airbnb doesn’t post these auto reviews then potential guests may be unaware that a host has canceled reservations before, possibly multiple times! Further, if Airbnb often doesn’t apply the penalties they say could be applied if a host cancels, then hosts may be aware that there is very little, if any, penalty for cancelations, and have no real incentive to think twice before ruining your plans. Why might a host cancel a reservation? I believe in my case the host likely learned that other people will pay them far more than what they listed on Airbnb because of a shortage of available rentals this season."
80,Erick,CH,3 reviews,"Saturday, January 29, 2022, 11:58:39 PM",1,total lack of transparency and clear support of fraudulent behaviors,"My first experience with AirBnB has highlighted the worst in that company. Clearly the company does not care about customers using the platform as guests. The lack of vision of AirBnB and the sole money making process focus (very short term) is hurting the customers. Further AirBnB very clearly not only protects dubious hosts but actively support fraudulent behaviors. The company seems quite disorganized and unprofessional with regard to the support teams and decisions are totally lacking the required transparency. Frightening: reviews are manipulated so guests do not have access to the information they need to make educated choices.I rented a property in Rio de Janeiro based on a high score (good reviews, score 4.8, superhost), the location and a written confirmation of the host through the AirBnB chat channel that the apartment was very quiet. Well to the complete opposite, the apartment was very noisy as located next to a hospital and in front of a key Copacabana avenue with extremely dense traffic. Further the property was far from its description in AirBnB as it was old, in poor shape, quite dirty and the pandemic rules were obviously not respected (no appropriate cleanup had been done prior to me checking-in). New to AirBnB I did not inform myself properly and could have, as AirBnB told me later, cancelled within 24 hours of the check-in. Equipped with good noise cancelling headset I thought I could manage the high level noise (40 to 55 Db inside the due to the traffic noise). Well I managed but not that well. Anyway the point is that a)	when I confronted the owner with her lies she started to be extremely rude, denying facts and in the end clearly insulting me in writing on the AirBnB chat channels.b)	AirBnB was technically responsive when I raised tickets regarding the issues (noise & host behavior) but very weak not to say unprofessional handling the issue (no real support, no commitment, apparently I only had to deal with very junior staff)c)	Finally I wrote a review which I had reviewed by an AirBnB staff through the chat to ensure it would not hurt any of the policy AirBnB claims to have and follow. At some point I got confirmation that my review was fine and compliant with the policies so I published it. The host got mad and insulted me in her review of me but actually the best part is that after a week my review was taken down under the obviously fallacious pretext that it was hurting some AirBnB policy. Of course there was absolutely no mention of what was not compliant in my review. I had rated my experience with a mere 3 and simply exposed the noise issue explaining that people sensitive to noise should think twice before renting. d)	It is also worth noting that the property which was rated as 4.8 before I rented it was, all of a sudden, rated with a full 5 after my review got taken down. How serious is that? A bit worrying that clearly data are manipulated, fact based reviews are taken down on simple hosts requests or else some hosts have quite “useful” connections with AirBnB employees (collusion). It is worth noting that my review got removed by an AirBnB employee with a clear Brazilian name (Vania) which is a further sign pointing at fraud for me.e)	The 3 tickets I raised to get my review put back online, for the case being investigated and for the insults of the host being removed failed to produce any tangible result. I had immediate response that my case was getting all the necessary attention but then nothing anymore for the first 2 tickets and my 3rd ticket was answered with the assertion that my review was hurting the policy but of course no further details as to why and how it was not compliant. A bad joke. A very bad company. I would strongly advise against using their services based on my experience covering pretty much all the aspects of the services offered by that company. Clearly it is my worst experience with regard to the hostel industry. The company is highly unprofessional. To a point that is very scary. The price for poor quality is always too high. My AirBnB experience was not even a cheap one. On the positive side I learned a lot and will avoid them at all cost in the future."

That was after I specifically asked him before booking if he used chemicals in his garden as I was planning to spend time outside. There were workers outside a lot of the time. He also lived in the same house but had a separate entrance, although on their website it was stated that I would be renting the entire house. After going back and forth with them for two months concerning the compensation they told me out of the blue that I contacted them too late after the incident occurred and thus they couldn't do anything for me. I didn't contact them too late according to their policy. And even if that happened which it didn't why correspond with me for two months after initial contact. But as I couldn't go on explaining things over and over to them when they were just dragging time I dropped the complaint. The second time when we lost $1000 they told me because I didn't have pictures to prove what wasn't right in the house they couldn't refund me. I sent all the pictures confirming the construction and painting from the other trip but that didn't make any difference.

After a dispute with 15 pictures and a video over a bait and switch listing and 5 hours on the phone, multiple emails and calls, Airbnb only refunded us $20 of a $500 stay, despite us leaving early due to poor rental conditions. Despite asking twice for a supervisor, they said they can only send a message for one to call - 2 days later, still no call. Endless run arounds. I used to think Airbnb was a great idea, that they made promises and had policies that would have your back. Wrong. I’ll never use Airbnb ever again, despite traveling every month. We were in a pinch - the hosted we stayed at with a 4.69 rating of 54 stays. Clearly a bad sign but he had lots of good ratings, but also some bad ones (most of which I didn’t see until after our stay. Airbnb doesn’t allow you to sort for review rank and we found out that if Airbnb cancels your reservation on your behalf (as in when you leave early due to a dispute), you can’t rate a host, so their reviews and ratings  can be artificially higher. The cabin we stayed at was not even the same as the one in the listing’s pictures, had listed amenities not present, had bugs in the refrigerator, stained cutlery, full of cob webs and clear neglect. We notified Airbnb immediately with pictures and videos attached. After filing a formal dispute, we got only the $20 cleaning fee back as a “cleaning oversight”. The host even yelled at us, accused us of trying to get a free night despite leaving at 7am - more than a day early into a 2 night stay and refused to listen to our concerns. We felt unsafe staying in a new room he offered. Airbnb did not only not have our back and failed to follow their own policies on accuracy postings, refund exceptions, cleanliness standards/promise and safety/community behavior, they profit on the fact they can collect twice on a night for a room that’s been already paid for. Airbnb actively dodges contacts, won’t reply to emails, chat or even calls when you’re in a dispute. Stick with hotels, where you have actual recourse."

I have been there before and it was fine - considering the cheap accommodation, I have always given good reviews, even if not everything was perfect. But this time it was a disaster. In the room it was 15 degrees Celsius (in January, while outside it was minus). I informed the host about it and he promised to fix the problem. Promises every day for 5 days. On the fourth day I asked him for electric heater, he did not answer. Around 11 pm (when I was already sleeping in another place) he sent me a message that he had put a hot water bottle in front of the door (which would not help with cold air). Then I could not sleep at 15 degrees anymore and looked for another place to rent. (I bought a thermometer to prove it, I have photos and messages). I informed AirBnb about it. Since I did not complain within 24 hours, they refused to refund me. I did get something back from the host, but I lost about half of the money I paid, not to mention the lost energy, time and health problems due to the low temperatures. Although I did not make a cancellation, it was made by someone else under my name. (Again, I have all the photos to prove it.) I left a review for his flat that contained only facts I could prove (given other reviews, I obviously was not the only one with this problem), but AirBnb deleted it. I think everyone can have 5 stars if all the bad reviews are deleted. Definitely my last trip with AirBnb."

102,Crystal Springs,US,6 reviews,"Saturday, January 22, 2022, 03:24:54 AM",2,Deceptive marketing strategies,"AirBNB refuses to implement a keyword search filter that would enable prospective renters to narrow down search results. For example if you want to search for a romantic stay in Seattle, you get to click through 300+ properties and manually read each description. AirBNB used to have this search capability but removed it a few years ago and refuses to bring it back even though tons of people complain about this lack of functionality.  AirBNB does currently has a similar search implemented on user reviews (so their dev team obviously know how to code a simple keyword search).  This is VERY basic website functionality so I don't see how its removal and omission are just an oversight. I believe AirBNB is intentionally making customers click through every property so they can inflate the click statistics on properties and justify higher fees on owners that list with AirBNB.  This is deceptive and needs to stop."

According to the house advertisement, if I canceled my reservation before the start date, I could get my money back and I canceled my reservation 5 days before the start date. I canceled within 30 seconds because I already made the reservation by mistake. But I did not get the money back. The host didn't answer me and AirBnB said that they talked to the host but didn't want to give the money. In that case, wasn't it necessary for AirBnB as an institution to take the money from him and give it to me? AirBnB told me that I had to take the money but the host didn't give it so I had to forget the money. And they didn't reply to my messages. I can't believe this disgrace. Anyway, I gave my lawyer the necessary information. The amount is not large, but this attitude pushed me to sue them. Please contact me if you have any problems and I will help you file a lawsuit against AirBnB and faceless hosts."

If you choose the instant booking it says that they will not penalize you if you have to cancel , but they will take all your money from the guest that you had to cancel and deducted from the other. The only way that they will not penalize you is if you say you don't feel confortable with a guest and if you let them cancel , even if they don't say that anyway. It't not a company to trust"

We rented an apartment for our family for 2 months during a remodel. The place was extremely dirty upon arrival, never cleaned. There were no promised linens (they were there, but dirty and unusable), zero drawers for clothing (which seems like a no-brainer), furnishings were subpar (felt like they left whatever they didn't want to move into their new place), and there were items left over from previous renters (including underwear). When an eviction notice showed up (the host hadn't paid rent for 5 months), we moved out immediately. The host said he would refund us, but would not. I had to spend days waiting for Airbnb to decide to read my support requests, and they finally got involved, put the host in his place, and gave us a refund. It was an extremely stressful situation during a stressful remodeling project. We had to move to a hotel, then found another place through an actually professional company."

If possible, try to contact a host first and establish availability before actually booking. Airbnb will, as procedure, establish a pending transaction with your bank before a host has agreed to your booking. Unfortunately in my case, the host advised that the dates would not be available and declined my booking request. The host in question was very friendly and prompt in their response and I have no I’ll will towards them. The problem is that Airbnb had set up a pending transaction for £500 from my account and this money was now locked for, what I have been advised, could be 7 business days. It makes booking another place very difficult to do as the funds are t readily available in my account unless I wish to dig further into my personal money. The further concern is that after 7 days and I have my money back, this could all happen again. To sum up: Airbnb have a terrible policy regarding pending transactions and will blame your bank, be careful before you book and try to communicate with your host before you consider booking."

When there is an issue with a booking, they cannot address it over the phone only pass it along to another team and tell you to wait several days for someone to get back to you, you are never allowed to speak with someone who can assist you. You cannot speak with a supervisor in the US. They have no care in the world to address the issues at hand, and no one holding them responsible for their actions and handling of situations.

121,J K,US,1 review,"Thursday, January 13, 2022, 03:03:10 AM",1,No Covid Refunds - Even for the Sick,"Airbnb has far too many flaw with its system that continually leaves its customers frustrated. Most recently, I needed to cancel my European vacation because the countries I were visiting were in lockdown because of the Omicron wave and two of my group members contracted Covid. If this doesn't fall under extenuating circumstances, I don't know what will (apparently getting sick 15 days before your trip and cancelling to give the hosts as much time to rebook hurts your case)Support members make you go in circles between hosts, resolution centers, and support messages all making you waste time and more likely to lose out on your money.Another annoyance is their ""refund"" policy. When I put $700 down for the first payment, I was under the impression given by the listing that it was 50% refundable. However, when I cancelled my stay, I got no money back because this was a refund of 50% of the total cost of the stay. Does Airbnb not understand what a refund is? You cannot give me money back that I haven't paid - they need to look up the definition of a refund so they stop angering their customers."

Not much anyone can do about that but to keep the property blocked over the new years period with no chance for anyone else to book cost us money. But AirBNB don't care about their hosts.

As a host of 8 properties, I've noticed over the past 6-12 months that their support is going down hill. If VRBO/HomeAway could improve their booking platform they might finally be able knock AirBnb off their perch. It's only a matter of time although VRBO has had plenty of that to improve their app since AirBnb started up and haven't. AirBnb employees managed to get a 112% return the day it listed and it's even more now. And subject to comments here, AirBnb always favoured guests because they earn more from them - not the hosts.

Every other business connected to my trip refunded the money in full, even Easyjet. It also appears that the host Aline rented out the property over the same period and kept my money.

The connection is nice, but the true value comes from the hosts who create and share their space. Recently I made arrangements for a longer stay while working at a major hospital system in the US with a highly rated Host who was noted for his cleanliness, proximity to the hospital, safety of the environment and desire for professionals to rent the space. On arrival, the property next door was abandoned with plywood over the windows, there was no external lighting on the property (check-in was after 5:00 pm after the sun went down), several light switches did not work, there was hair everywhere including in the beds, moldy food in the refrigerator and green slime in the dishwasher and drying racks. I immediately reached out to the Host informing him of my problems with photos, to which he replied he would come by in three days with another light bulb and clean the place better.I proceeded to request a refund and find alternative accommodations at a local hotel. He agreed to the full refund and acknowledged the issues, but when I placed a request with AirBnB it was not processed. I submitted a ticket with customer service the same day and (14 days later) have still not heard back from them. Ultimately, due to their cancellation policy I was charged $800 for the initial deposit up to 30 days of occupancy. This is in light of the fact that their guarantee and refund policy says I am entitled to a FULL REFUND at their discretion if there are safety and health concerns or if the host misrepresents the posting. I love the idea of AirBnB, but their verification process for hosts and their customer service quality are horrendous."

They also gave me their verbal word (recorded on phone conversation) to refund the remaining nights and then reneged. I used to love Airbnb, but they are apparently now become fraudulent so I will never use them again.

Do yourself a favor and just spend the extra money on a hotel instead. I had multiple complications with my 8 day stay: a guest was rude and left messes in multiple rooms, another dog brought in flees thus infecting my 8 week old puppy, the bed I was sleeping on completely collapsed and I had to spend the night on the cold hardwood floor in the winter time, and for half my stay the host was out of town and wouldn’t even send anyone to even help fix any of my issues. It was up to another renter and myself.  Air bnb never got back to me with a solution the night my bed broke. I had to call them back the next morning. I was told I was entitled to a refund having done everything right by sending in proof of these things and within 24 hours. But because it was New Years and I could not get a hotel and was forced to “complete my stay”. My case was closed and I’m now only getting a refund of $37 when one night was $48 and I was there for 8 nights. This was unacceptable. Absolutely horrible. Stay on an air mattress in your parents house or your friends couch before you choose air bnb. I’ll tell this to everyone."

However ,when entering the property we were supprised to find dishes on the drainer, a fridge full of food and it was obvious someone was living there. When the owner arrived we expressed our concern and he said to take it uo with Air bnb and we should get a refund. During our stay there was only one key so we had to find out if the owner was in everytime we went out and even with very high levels of covid infections there was no sanitation cleaning obvious and a smell of other peoples cooking etc. Funnily the listing was changed the day after we arrived to include the words SHARED HOUSE in bold letters on the main page . Air bnb denied this( but later agreed that it had happened after I accused them of lying) and said we were aware of the situation but why would we complain if we knew. They have just said it was our fault and so we will NOT be using them again and I urge everyone to do the same.Shamefull"

149,K S,US,1 review,"Wednesday, January 5, 2022, 07:24:33 PM",1,"AirBNB mistakenly cancelled our Christmas rental reservation and kept $3,000 deposit paid six months ago!","My husband and I lost roughly $3,000 to AirBNB and a host in Fairview, NC, near Asheville, due to a mistaken cancellation that was the fault of AirBNB. Not only did we lose this money, which was our deposit paid six months ago, we learned of the cancellation the day we were meant to arrive at the house for the Christmas holiday. We were leaving from our rental in Macon, GA, halfway on route from Southwest Florida, with four others traveling in to Asheville that same day from New York, Mexico and Raleigh. I went to the website to double check the address to type into Maps and saw that the reservation had been cancelled! We had to scramble to find a new place because the property was rebooked to someone else and the host had no other vacancies.The host initially assured us he would absolutely refund the deposit but he said there was nothing else he could do and we had to work the rest out with AirBNB. AirBNB seemed reasonable at first, even suggesting they may reimburse us if we book another AirBNB reservation. So, I booked another AirBNB nearby (not nearly as nice but there were few options for 6 people and a dog at Christmas). After I booked the alternative place, AirBNB changed their tune and not only didn't mention reimbursing us again, but also said they couldn't release the deposit without the host's permission. I'm not sure what AirBNB said to the host when they called to get his permission, but whatever they said changed the host's mind and he decided NOT to refund the $3,000 deposit.So of course you're wondering what the error was. Well, AirBNB sent ALL of our booking correspondence to my husbands active email account - the one he used to book the reservation - naturally, right? They sent a final billing reminder for the balance due to an old email address my husband never uses! We had no idea there was a deadline to pay prior to arrival, much less that the deadline had arrived! We paid the deposit at the time of booking in July. We fully understood and were ready to pay when asked, but since the billing correspondence went to the wrong email we had no idea. AirBNB assumed we were cancelling. This happened on Dec. 14. Oddly, my husband received a reservation confirmation - with NO mention of a balance due - to his active email account the VERY SAME day!!! To make things even more confusing, the Host's received a notification that my husband had cancelled the reservation that day too, with no explanation, no indication that AirBNB made the cancellation without our knowledge.Coincidentally, I had called the host on Dec. 14 too. Probably when my husband saw the reservation confirmation, he asked me to request a late check-out. I called the host. He said he needed to call the cleaning crew and get back to me. He never did. The day that we were driving to the place and found out about the mistake, the host said he thought it was odd that we had cancelled the reservation but he figured we changed our minds. He really should have called us. Someone should have called us.This is really AirBNB's fault. They made no effort to contact us by any other means to let us know there was any sort of payment deadline. The hosts didn't know there was such a deadline either or they would have known why the reservation was cancelled. We had every intention in the world and the means to pay the balance but with absolutely no communication about payment and plenty of communication about our reservation, including a confirmation the same day, how would we know our reservation was in jeopardy?AirBNB has refused to work this out with us. Everyday we call and get a different person who says we need to talk to someone else. They say they will escalate it and someone will call us back the next day. No one ever has called us back, not even late. It has been over a week now and we still have yet to talk to anyone with authority to remedy the situation.Making matters worse, this whole ordeal hung over us the whole time we were trying to celebrate Christmas together as a family. We hadn't travelled in ages and it ended up being a nightmare. The place we booked was a luxury cabin with each bedroom containing a king size bed. We ended up in a campy little place on a busy highway, near a hairpin turn and my mother in law had to sleep in a bunk bed. Our bedroom had no windows! And there were no king sized beds. It was the only option available that met our basic needs.Since our calls are going unanswered, we are beginning to feel like this is a scam tactic AirBNB uses to make more money. Why would they send billing and confirmation correspondence to two separate emails instead of sending all correspondence to both emails if they're not sure one is correct, especially when it comes to billing and reservations!"

They have zero accountability for the hosts and barely a thread of customer service now for their guests.  They have opened up their platform to scammers and when you try and call to get help about it, they offer no attempt to resolve the problem.  The only solutions they have responded with are other options of places to stay on their platform.  We found out from the building manager that our ""host"" isn't a real person, he's just a picture and a fake name.  Hence why when we try and reach out to the host we aren't getting resolutions because the host is a fraud to begin with.  It's such a shame that AirBnB has let this happen to their platform."

I have not received one single email or text message from Airbnb not even on my junk mail, (apparently you need to manually allow the app to authorise messages being delivered to you)  but I never knew this. If I had received any email messages about my accomodation being canceled I would have called immediately, instead of travelling to find out that I had no place to stay. Airbnb Australia is so irresponsible that  they simply canceled my booking without even considering calling to confirm if I was still travelling.  I have since talked to many customer service officer and they don’t keep notes of my case and I have to repete this case to every single person over and over and the case does not get escalated or actioned. I had to book additional hotel accommodation and have 1K out of pocket expenses.

Back when the pandemic started I booked an airbnb stay that I ended up having to cancel due to all the travel restrictions. The host screwed me up by not giving me a full refund even though the whole world was starting a shutdown. Airbnb issued a coupon but messed up and issued it into 2 separate coupons of which you cannot use them together on a stay. Then the traveling restrictions for NYC never eased up and I could not use the coupon until this week...a few days before the coupon was due to expire. I called airbnb to ask for an extension and unfortunately they denied me. So I have booked a stay for the end of the year and the host had in very small print at the very end of this listing that you have to be vaxxed to stay at their house. I have a valid medical exemption from the vaccine so the host told me to just cancel my reservation. I ended up canceling the reservation since I am not fully vaxxed. I cancelled the reservation and did not get the value of my coupon returned to me. Airbnb customer service said that the host has to cancel in order for me to get my coupon returned to me. I reached out to the host and she did not even know that she has to cancel first in order to give me the coupon back. So now I have reached out to a supervisor and they said it can take up to 2 days for them to get back to me with a resolution. Well my stay was starting on the 29th of Dec and now I have no refund (that can take up to 2 days) and out the $100 coupon AND no place to say in 3 days. Everything is booked in my area.

Then airbnb makes the guest jump through hoops to get the money back. It should be the other way around. This incudes waiting time for the guest. So, 3 days before the trip, it is not resolved. Do airbnb want us to travel and show up because we have an uncancelled and prepaid booking despite the host messaged that he cancelled.

They got reimbursed 50pct as per the strict cancellation rules. They then advised a day later that they tested positive to Covid and asked to invoke the extenuating circumstances to get a full reimbursement, which Airbnb granted them, at my expense. Given they had already cancelled their stay because of some travel issue, how can Airbnb accept later the extenuating circumstances related to Covid to reimburse them fully? I am really let down as a host."

Well, it wasn't. The bed sheets were dirty and had a cig burn. The bed had no pillow but a soiled cushion. The bed had no blanket and the heat was off from 11pm to 5am in December. The bathroom vanity had roaches and was not heated. The tiles around the tub were moldy. When I complained to the co-host he told me I must be a big liar and what I needed was a babysitter. After purchasing my own bed sheets and pillow I spent the booked time there complaining every day about the same things. When I returned to Europe and overcame the jetlag a few days later I found the time to write to airbnb (attached all the photos I made of all my complaints) and I left a review. But neither the review was published nor the claim was paid attention to but the claim case was closed by airbnb the day after, without any further investigation. It seems that airbnb is protecting the hosts regardles of the guest's complaints. Airbnb is only up to receive the commission from the bookings, has the 24hr complaint rule after checkout because they know most guests travel overseas and time difference and jetlag will play in their favor. My advise is: don't ruin your vacation because with airbnb you get what you pay for!"

We submitted a dispute:1. You absolutely can NOT get a live person on the phone…. You can literally spend THOUSANDS of dollars with this company and they can’t even bother to pick up the phone .2. The non refundable deal is BS, it’s almost like they KNOW people will realize that some of these hosts misrepresent their properties and pre-plan to steal folks money.3.

Earlier this year a 3 week stay was cancelled the day before we were due to arrive.  We finally found another place, but as it was a last minute reservation, it cost us several hundred dollars more than budgeted (even after Airbnb begrudgingly gave us some small compensation toward the new place which was $1000+ more than budgeted). More recently, a stay for next month was cancelled. Again we will have to pay more for a comparable stay. In addition, we attempted to buy a gift card through Airbnb. Though the charge was posted to our count (twice) the gifts did not go through either time. It took weeks for the charge to finally drop off. Airbnb has done nothing to compensate for the aggravation and additional costs we will need to incur. Their customer service representatives are polite, but they do nothing to actually help."

Well I did pay again and 2 stays money was taken from me.  He told me to get the money back directly from Airbnb and what a nightmare.  I was lied to 4 times by customer service ambassadors 😂 -told all resolved and I would get my refund on 2 separate occasions - when money not paid back I phoned again - told supervisor on lunch break so I phoned again and told supervisor on phone so phone again and advised there aren't supervisors in the centre and the previous ambassadors had been untruthful.   The host didn't return calls or messages (laughing all the way to the bank).  Finally, the only way I got my money back was to leave a message to say I would just have to come and get it when I was in the area as he would not communicate with me.  I am a 5ft 3’ 60-year-old woman walking for charity and honestly havent a bad bone in my body but refuse to be conned and lied to.  I will NEVER book to stay in an Airbnb property again.

Property is unsafe and unsanitary with a manhole in the internal washroom which really smells up place. The place is filled mould everywhere. Very greedy and mean man who Airbnb must ban. I told Airbnb the host should no be renting out property. They let him relist property again? Why? It is not set up safely, and as a non smoking listing, why are guests smoking?

We offered to let the host keep our money and simply change the dates to April (the host has availability in April on the Airbnb website) however he refused. He also refused a 50% refund. So we are now out of pocket by thousands of pounds due to the French government bringing in restrictions last minute. You might be thinking “that’s what insurance is for!” - nope!

Only concened with protecting their hosts and profits.,">>Very bad customer service (particularly from Vanessa). Ignored my concerns and a potentially dangerous situation. Seems they are only concened with protecting their hosts and profits.Along with my partner I have been using Airbnb pretty much full time for 2 years travelling and staying throughout Europe. We recently booked a month stay in an apartment in Lviv, Ukraine. The apartment was nice but did have a smell (eggy/mouldy) which seemed to be coming from outside the apartment (this was never percieved as a danger). Without making the connection my health had been declining for 2 weeks with a nasty chest infection (I have asthma but this was something more). 2 weeks into the stay my partner whilst cleaning discovered an open space in the floorboards which upon looking further was full of black mould and there was a strong smell coming from there. Immediately upon discovering this the connection to my chest infection was made and we informed the landlady that we were moving out. We were nice and cordial and just wanted to inform her but of course we also wanted a refund. The landlady only refunded us based on our actual stay (which of course made the daily charge for those 2 weeks much more). This we felt was not so gracious especially as it was opened up straight for booking again after we asked her to check the health danger. After moving out I visited the doctors who perfomed a spirometry test and also a cat scan (I have all the documents for this which I will be using in a legal case). Turns out I had a bad lung infection (not bronchitus luckily) but not pleasant and although better is still uncomfortable 2.5 weeks later. The doctors confirmed that the black mould was a very likely cause of my health as I was exposed for a long time in a small space with heating and windows closed. After explaining the situation to AirBnb on the messaging app about my tests etc and what I was going through they kept saying that I didn't inform them within 24 hours and therefore it was out of their refund policy. According to their policy they have one also for after 24hours. I explained to Vanessa at least 4 times (all recorded in the thread) that we only discoverd the actual health risk after 2 weeks on which we immediatly acted. They kept saying you were aware of the smell in the beginning and should have reported it then! It is like not reporting some flickering lights and then getting electrocuted 2 weeks later by a loose wire which was the cause! What Vanessa kept posting lacked any common sense and they did not listen to my explantion basically just copying and pasting the same response about we understand what you must be going through etc etc but you should have reported it withing 24hours of arrival. Most importantly my main complaint and concern is that I asked them a number of times to confirm that they will investigate the property as a health risk. They ignored this. I also asked for the thread to be escalated to a senior - again constantly ignored. The cherry (mouldy one unfortunately!) on the cake which makes me all the more motivated to let people know about this is that they today removed my option to review the property! I am not a vindictive person who would want to affect anyones livelihood and was even hoping the host (who apart from this seemed very nice) would sort the situation. That is why I didn't leave a host review earlier! I will be sharing this post on all AirBnB channels and also an SEO optimised blog on this situation. We were good customers of theirs (will never use them again) but as soon as there was an issue they just ignored and turned away from any responsibility - their most important responsibility to ensure there is not a future danger in an apartment they are renting. If any false comeback by Airbnb is made in response to this I will post the entire actual thread here to show their exact colours. It is already clear to most though as the current rating on trustpilot is 1.4."

We used to book lovely unique stays through them, frequently, however they have recently implemented what they class as “security checks” which block guests from booking full properties. They instead advise you to book a hotel or private room, which simply removes the guest’s preference and choice of stay. This is purely smoke and mirrors tactics and only harms independent hosts, trying to remove them in favour of corporate hotels. This is a slippery slope of control. We will not be using Airbnb again."

My mother had to wash every dish in the house. There were spider webs, trash left behind, cleaning product residue left on surfaces, etc. I couldnt use the jacuzzi tub because there was Comet residue left in it. We also requested more towels and they were never delivered. I was forced to pay the cleaning fee and the host did not refund me anything and when I told Air BnB about my terrible experience they sided with the host. The host offered to send a house cleaner mid-stay which was prime COVID so we didn’t want to interact with anyone and also the place should’ve been cleaned before we got there so I didn’t think that was a good way to solve the problem. Because I did not want the cleaner to come during our stay Air BnB denied me any support. I cancelled my account right after and will never book Air Bnb and want people to know about their terrible policies that are not customer friendly and overall it seems like they condone bad quality among their hosts."

I asked for a 50% refund as a guest in an apartment I booked for 3 weeks which was dirty (foul smell, mold and hair clog in the shower…) and extremely noisy (baby crying at night next door and renovations during the day starting from 7am, including on Sundays…). I basically couldn’t sleep for 3 weeks. All this with extensive video and photo proof. They stated that it was up to the Host to refund me, and that Airbnb had no say in the process (which is the opposite of what is written in their own policy). I have filed a complaint with the national customer protection agency in my country, which probably won’t result in much."

We contacted Airbnb with 6 weeks notice as we requested a refund, they said they would only give us 50% back minus the service fee as they don't recognize covid as a valid reason to cancel.  I asked the host for a refund and he said no.  I tried changing the dates for next year so we wouldn't lose our money and the host said he is fully booked, even though Airbnb said they weren't.  We lost a lot of money and Airbnb were very unhelpful.  Really disappointing experience, will not use them again."

231,Leyah,US,1 review,"Monday, December 6, 2021, 10:13:50 AM",1,Highway Robbery,"Last month I booked an Airbnb for a month in Orlando. About an hour after I booked my husband tells me there was a conflict with the dates and his work, so I contacted the host and asked to cancel (1.5 hours after booking). The host replied 10 hours later, he refused saying he lost two people who were interested in those dates and so he will not be refunding me. All I would get is the cleaning fee if I chose to cancel on my own. I contacted Airbnb support and tried to reason with the host to reconsider since I would be losing $3000+. I offered to pay a percentage, anything, just please don't take all of my hard-earned money. The host refused and refused to even respond to me. Airbnb had to tell me his decision. My booking was from today, I noticed that the host has managed to book his place for the entirety of what was my stay. So not only is he keeping my money but he is also making money off of this place for the entire month. Christmas will be nice for him I guess. Airbnb has refused to help me. There is no support for customers only for hosts who are free to exploit people with zero conscience. One major red flag was the fact that the message where he tells me the reason he cannot refund me is that he lost out on bookings is deleted because that reason is now null and void. I didn't even know that was possible?! Airbnb is disgusting for allowing predatory behaviour by hosts who are exploiting a system that was setup to protect them from losing money due to last-minute cancellations. It's now being used to double dip by being paid multiple times for the same rental. How is this ok?"

I could choose to upload a photo of my passport, identity card or driver's license. I don't have a driver's license and identity cards in my country don't have photos, so I chose my only option: passport. I have a temporary passport, which is valid until 3rd of July 2022 but it got denied. I then tried to upload my expired passport but that also got denied. I tried uploading my identity card despite it not having a photo, and, yet again, DENIED. I chatted to one of your employees throughout it all and he was trying to be helpful but nothing worked and in the end I simply could not book with you. I find this appalling and ridiculous. I verified my bank details but that wasn't good enough either. The Airbnb has now been booked by someone else and is no longer available, and I am FUMING.

If it is posted to the wrong account, if it is posted to a deactivated account or any other similar mistake happens, you will lose your money and Airbnb will not refund it. They will also stop all your attempts to cancel the charge through your bank. They are greedy. They have purposely set up their support line, their app, their bot, Facebook and Twitter to ensure that you cannot speak to anyone or get a resolution. No one actually reads the messages which you can tell from the canned responses that you receive. When it comes down to it Airbnb will carefully word their policies so that they define the terms and they can steal your money without repercussion.I bought a $200 gift card for someone who traveled a lot. The card was “ redeemed”on their account but the account has been deactivated and Airbnb will not reactivate it. By the terms of their policy, the gift card has been redeemed and cannot be refunded. However this card cannot be used in the $200 will just sit there. Airbnb made their money and they don’t care if anyone else gets what they paid for. The simple solution would have been to refund me, or let me purchase a second gift card with the funds. Neither were offered. In fact no solutions were offered. After spending almost an hour on the phone with support,I was forced to end the call with the support person, ARIS. I was told that they would not connect me with a manager or supervisor unless I hung up. When I explained to ARIS that I did not want to get off the phone because I doubted that anyone would actually call me, he promised they would. He also told me that all the calls were recorded and that they listened to the calls to make sure that follow-up calls were made. I never received a call. On that phone call he told me that they were set up to work from home but only had their phones and no other platform to connect with anyone at the company. Therefore he could not escalate the issue with me on the phone. again, no one ever called. Three days later I received a message that ARIS had closed my request and that they would “Politely disengage from further discussion of this case”. Got the same message on Facebook and Twitter."

I have seen many photographers hosting an experience on Airbnb so I thought it's good idea to do the same thing and I was very excited about that. And I started to submit my experience which was very similer to the photographers on Airbnb and for no reason my submission got declined.. I thought I might have done something wrong so I spend 2 days reading through thier policy again try to see what was I have done wrong or against thier policy but actually I haven't found anything wrong! So I thought to give it another trial and speak with customer service to see if they have any recommendations and then I submitted a new experience and again my submission got declined. I asked customer service just to let me know what was the refusal reason and all what they have replied we don't have access to your experience and we can't provide you with what was wrong ... seriously!!! So I spent more than 3 days wasting my time trying to apply and its very simple for them to say we don't know lol .. anyway I'd never waste my time again with this horrible experience and I can continue work just for myself and not worth it to give them any commission from my actual work!!!

So I cancelled my reservation. 2/ Your site claims that you don't take payment until booking confirmation. I'm sorry but blocking my funds until the reservation is confirmed is basically taking a payment from me, as I can't use the funds for something else.3/ Today, 24hrs later, my funds still haven't been released by my bank. So I don't even have sufficient funds to make another booking now, which is compromising my trip. I am left with having to make a hotel booking where payment is made during the stay.

WE cannot get any help on Airbnb changing the payment dates.  We have one guest that recently brought to our attention that Airbnb has changed their payment due date.  This trickles down to us as the super host for delaying our payments.  Years ago we weould receive money with 48 hours.  Now it takes 7-10 business days.  After some investigation and discussing with many other local hosts, we are understanding that Airbnb is making money on the ""float"" interest of the 10 days and keeping the guests' payment longer than necerssary.  So much longer that if it falls on a weekend, the payment has been taking 10-14 days to receive now.  In our experience, this was not the case until recently.  I wish there was a way to provide feedback to Airbnb with a native English speaking person as well.  Everyone is in Singapore or Phillipines and also on vacation, only getting back to us 5-8 days later some times.  The host support is ridiculous.  i would give them zero stars if I could.

Being currently morally against the idea of travel in the midst of an ongoing pandemic, I have simply asked to extend this credit for an additional year, or otherwise refund it in whichever way they'd see fit.

We left early in the morning, so the host told us to leave the keys on the table. Couple of days later we received a bill for damages we haven't had done, but since we couldn't prove it we had to pay. I found some bad reviews for this host from guests with basically almost the same problems and issues we had. Airbnb provides no protection for the guests, who can obviously be charged for the renovation of someone's old furniture."

My flight was cancelled and I couldn't arrive on time. I informed the host that I can't check in on time and will arrive a few days later. He said ok, no problem. But in 24 h after my reservation started, he cancelled the reservation. As my reservation was non-refundable, I did not get anything. I tried to contact the help centre, but they said if I didn't check-in during 24h. the host has the right to cancel my reservation. Also, tried to reach the host after that, but he didn't respond to my messages.Update. The host settled new customers on my dates and got double profit. Airbnb deleted my review for the host.

269,LM,US,1 review,"Tuesday, November 23, 2021, 04:41:45 PM",1,Airbnb stands behind their toxic hosts behaviors - they are equally unethical,"The host I had experience with was horrible! She seemed nice the first day, though she overshared and used a lot of profanity with me as a complete stranger. I had to excuse myself and the conversation where she was griping about something that had nothing to do with me. Her house was nasty - pubic hairs in bar soap left in the shower, trash in all bins, hair in the bed, burned oven, dirty dishes and laundry left for me to clean before I could use the amenities, etc. She also had a dog that ran up to my guests and it seemed she did not like that my guest moved away from a dog they did not know as she seemed to feel we should have cuddled with it or something. She in turn reported me for ""discrimination against her dogs behavior,"" which Airbnb supported. This defames my character. The host was belligerent and attacking in behavior at my guests fear over her dog. She labeled me as having an attitude as well as told us we were ""the only guest she has had who are (long pause) like you are!"" When asked to explain, she avoided. She walked up to me aggressively, pointing her finger and with a raised voice. My fear of her unpredictable behavior was dismissed by Airbnb. They continued to support the hosts nasty house, failure to provide the home in the condition it was advertised and her aggressive behavior. I will not support this company after speaking with 7 agents who are all on the same page of failing their customers and instead stand behind their hosts instead. They will be hearing from my attorneys and it is sad that I have to stretch it to this extent!"

I immediately decided to cancel my Air BnB at 2:10pm on Friday 19th November, as the app stated that any request made before 3pm on the 19th would result in a full refund.Unfortunately, the app then said that I was only entitled to 50% refund as the deadline had passed. Turns out Air BnB supposedly have some small print which states that the refund deadline is based on the host country, meaning that I missed out by a matter of minutes, even though I had requested a refund before the deadline stated in-app.After a frankly abysmal experience with customer service, going round and round with their shoehorned script and lack of answers, I’ve been told that Austria’s national lockdown does not constitute Extenuating Circumstances. In what world can a pandemic restricting all flights to the host country not count as extenuating circumstances? - That is laughable.My current situation is that it’s supposedly up to the host as to whether I get a full refund, and he needs to reply in order to grant me any refund, let alone the full one that I deserve. However, he hasn’t replied for 4 days and my trip is supposed to be in 2 days. If he doesn’t reply by the time the trip happens then I get 0% refund, I.e. the host has literally 0 motive to respond to me, yet the clueless customer support team at Air BnB don’t seem to realise this.I had previously loved Air BnB, but this service has put me off using them altogether, as they always side with the host despite evident extenuating circumstances, have an inconsistent and unclear refund policy and have some of the most incompetent staff that I’ve ever come across."

I told them what had happened and they explained that someone would look into it, and I even got an email saying that they would get back to me.

When we arrived at the AirBnb apartment (it was 1am in Dubai), the door was wide open, the room was filthy dirty (we paid €150/night) , there were bugs in the flat, we have found bed bugs, mould on the wall and near the bed. The flat was in such a bad and dirty condition, that nobody would be able to stay at flat. The flat was listed from a “super host”. We immediately got in touch with AirBnb support, the customer rep seemed to be very friendly “so sorry to hear that” and phrases like “thank you for your patience” were repeated to us. “Dont worry , we will fix everything” - Well nothing has been solved , the rep just hung up, and never called us back, we have waited for 1h (2am Dubai time), and nothing has been done by Airbnb. So we decided to get an update and called Airbnb back (on US number from dubai its very expensive), another customer support rep picked up, and the whole process was repeated “so sorry to hear that” “we ll fix everything”. Long story short, nothing has been fixed!!! We called Airbnb repeatedly and they havent helped us. After 4 hours of waiting and calling, we received a coupon for one night of stay, they money that we paid upfront will be sent back within 15 days and we had to find a hotel at 5am in the morning. This has been by the the worst experience of my life and I do not recommend to stay anybody with Airbnb. If you are in trouble or have any serious problems, you are on your own and will need to fight in order to get even your money back. Airbnb has by far the worst customer support from any of the big companies, and its nicely disguised with empty phrases like “so sorry to hear that”. They just dont care , everytime you call, you get connected to a different person, they dont really tell you their name, so there is no accountability and if he doesnt resolve the issue - well guess what no consequences for him/her. Dont stay with Airbnb , this is like rolling the dice, sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you get such a bad experience and a bad stay, that if you require help , Airbnb wont help you, you are on your own in a foreign country."

When we arrived a door knob was falling off the door, a cabinet also was halfway off and a towel holder was broke. Microwave wasn’t working .When letting management know they had the nerve to ask if i could also be around for them to also fix like 5/6 other problems in the apt they had a work order for?? I asked why would they NOT have this fixed before said move in date? Why should I be inconvenienced as I already was?? I was told they didn’t have time. The following week my husband found the guest bathroom falling off the hinges, which was dangerous and could have fallen on my son! Ridiculous! We saw maintenance more within our stay than we did the neighbors!! When they fixed said door guess what, they locked it from the inside and we were never able to get into the guest bathroom for full stay nor did anyone come to fix it after we complained! We did ask for some kind of small relief/ a 10% refund due to all these issues and having to pretty much host the maintenance workers lol and the fact all these things were broken and should have been FIXED for that kind of money during this pandemic and management refused with know explanation! Again ridiculous! The building is nice, the people were kind and maintenance were wonderful. The host and the condition of the apt not so, You would do better to look elsewhere!

After speaking to some air bnb customer service reps though I'm not too sure. The whole thing and company seems fake and just shambles. The person on Facebook is asking for two months rent upfront then changed it to three months rent upfront. I called air bnb because I thought this was some fraudulent activity going on. For the first representative to sigh heavily on the phone and speak to me like I was a piece of rubbish. Would not put me through to a manager. Told me to hang up and speak to someone else if I was not satisfied. Second customer service rep would not put me through to a manager due to me not spending money with the company and ended up hanging up the phone. Spoken to a third customer service rep and they also hung up the phone after me saying I wanted to put a complaint in. Avoid this company at all costs. What a disgrace.

After researching and planning we finally picked a place to stay. Contacted the owner via the site and decided to pay half of the 2500 balance upfront and then the rest of it about a two weeks from our planned stay. Just shortly after we paid the remaining balance we were informed that the property was sold and that I would need to rebook via the new owner if I want to still have a vacation. We were told to cancel the charge through our credit card, cancel the reservation and in parallel rebook with the new owner. Which we did. Turns out that doing this violated Airbnb's cancellation policy. Mind you we booked the same address for the same amount of days. When we only received 50% of our refund. We then reached back out to Airbnb to ask them why, we were told that we would receive the full refund and it would take 5-15 days (have it in writing). When the 15 days expired and no refund was given I reached back out to Airbnb. They have since changed their tune and said ""you violated the cancellation policy"" so we are keeping the other 50% plus the processing fee of $270. To me it seems that Airbnb has found a way to double dip on their bookings on a technicality. Too bad I can only rate my experience with one star."

Finally, we will have to wait almost an hour after reaching the place for the caretaker to reach with keys.Most importantly, the listing had mentioned 2 bedrooms, but there were two interconnected rooms, the 1st one was the living room (which the hosts claim as bedroom 1) and then you need to enter bedroom 2. So, if ppl from bedroom 2 needs to use the restroom then they have to go into bedroom 1 (at inappropriate timings) and then out of the house to use the bathroom.

Loyal customer since 2014, no more. I will no longer be booking through airbnb. The customer service was horrible. The customer service rep on the phone was named Raul, he was absolutely no help. He just liked hearing the sound of his own voice and gave us no options to help us. The entire process was shady from the start as the host, Michael, asked me to cancel my airbnb booking and book through him instead for a 10% discount. we obviously refused and continued through airbnb. Fast forward to today, my host cancelled on me the day before I was going to move in. So here I am stranded supposed to be going to London tomorrow with no place to stay and 2 kids. Michael cancelled on me today and sent me a whole sob story regarding the reason for cancelling this last minute. Michael emailed us through airbnb about an emergency water leak and mold which caused him to cancel our reservation the day before we were meant to move in. he also claimed that he had no other listings he could put us up in. Come to find out he has over 45 listings and if you read the reviews of Michael you'll see that this suspicious last minute cancellation is a common theme. He is a con artist who puts people through miserable situations. Michael claimed to Airbnb that he cancelled on us because he felt uncomfortable with us staying there and claimed we were going to throw a party. we are a family of four who are here for family time because of a graduation, in no way was there any indication that a party was going to happen. He completely lied about us with no evidence and airbnb believed it!! Ridiculous! We have been loyal airbnb users and only have great reviews written about us. Raul, the customer service guy, told us about the party complaint and then halfway through the conversation he took it back and claimed he never said that. Instead, Raul claimed that the real reason was the emergency water leak, but this was after 30 minutes of him stating over and over that this infamous party was the sole reason. both Michael and Raul were extremely unprofessional, however Michael acted in bad faith and criminally. I had been planning this trip for 3 months as I'm in London for my sons graduation, and now we must find a place by tomorrow or we'll end up homeless. So I have to find a place to stay in London the day before I must be there and booking this last minute is obviously outrageously expensive. So here I am without a place to stay, out of money due to the refund exchange rate, and about to be out a lot more money as I have to book another place immediately. This is singlehandedly the worst experience renting a place in my life and I've been renting for years. Michael better get flagged and reviewed by airbnb as he is a fraudulent con artist who scams people out of their money through last minute cancellations and exchange rates.  In conclusion, never book with Michael in London and if you value your time, money, yourself, your family, and your sanity you'll save yourself the headache and not book with airbnb at all. good luck."

Our stay was unpleasant and we checked out a day early. There was no working television/streaming services as advertised, which issue was not timely resolved.  We were unable to have a single shower where the hot water lasted more than a couple minutes, which wasn’t enough time to wash shampoo out of our hair given the weak water pressure. The street noise and noise from within the building (particularly the front door opening and closing and the constant double parking of food delivery service cars outside the bedroom window) was sleep, peace and quiet preclusive.  The freezer (without our use) began beeping in the middle of the night, waking us up just hours before the 5 am street cleaning did. The street cleaning did however get me out of bed to move my car, unfortunately, not before receiving a $90 ticket.  Street cleaning on Mondays and Tuesdays could easily have been advertised/cautioned to customers staying on those days.  The host refunded 2 nights worth of our 3 night stay, and Airbnb refunded the full service fee, nevertheless we still paid $398 for two nights, Airbnb would not refund any portion of the taxes paid based on the full price of the transaction despite our early departure. We would have been much better off in a hotel, and would recommend that alternative to others."

I kept photos when we left, the place was immaculate and no one wet the bed (the kids are too old). Her past shows similar vengeful comments, particularly for non-British and those who give her less than a 5-star review, just attacks them, using the same comments (child wet the bed, left the place a mess). I complained to Airbnb and they're refusing to remove her comments, despite the fact the host has no proof and I have photos when we left.Avoid Sharon's place from Scurlage Village in Walles and shame on you AirBnb for allowing lies and xenophobic attitude on your platform.

I had a string of 5* reviews. I made a lot of money for Airbnb.A few days ago I was delisted and banned from accessing my account.Why? You tell me. This is the message I received when I tried to access my account:“We're sorry, but you have been banned from using this site.You have been banned for the following reason:We regret to inform you that we'll be unable to support your account. We have exercised our discretion under our Terms of Service to disable your account. This decision is irreversible and will affect any duplicated or future accounts.”I have a fairly good idea what the reason they refuse to state was but I will never know for sure.We used to accept families with children but after several incidents involving vandalism, wanton destruction, and just plain filth we listed our property as “not suitable for infants or children under 12.”Some time ago they began notifying people that “Listing your property as ‘Not suitable for children or infants’ does not exempt you from hosting families.”So I guess you can warn people that there are often alligators in your unfenced swimming pool, but if they want to bring their uncontrollable children anyway, you have to accept them.I elected to ignore this incredibly presumptuous mandate and stated prominently in my listing that if a guest shows up with anyone under 12 or more than 4 people in total they will not be allowed to enter the house.A guest with no previous reviews, no profile and no approved payment method made a request for a booking for 1 adult and 3 children. She also mentioned that one or more other adults “might” be joining them for a birthday celebration.I asked for additional information and she ignored me.After waiting 12 hours I declined her request. No parties, maximum occupancy 4, no children and no unregistered visitors.8 minutes later my account disappeared.So, if you want to list your property with Airbnb, just keep in mind that you are giving up your rights to protect yourself. They plan to use it any way they want, and if you refuse to accept ANYONE for ANY reason, you can be accused of discrimination and banned.If you really want to be in the STR business I suggest that you try VRBO."

All 3 beds had hair, grass and one had a dead bug. Their was a musky smell throughout the property, with ""do not touch"" labels everywhere, which did not make it feel very welcoming.After 1 night we left and complained to the owner, her first message was ""you have planeted stuff"" calling us liars and being very rude. We immediatly raised this issue with Airbnb, who said ""its not up to us, its up to the owner to refund you, we are not getting involved"" and refused to do anything to help us.so we paid for 5 nights, used 1 night, got insulted and no help from Airbnb. They are a payment service that's it acting as a middle man, taking their 15%ish cut but do nothing for the customer, just keeping the owners sweet.Disgusting company and i will never use them again and encourage everyone i know to avoid them. Rather go direct with a property owner.Notice they have been featuring alot on consumer programs about what a joke of a company they are."

The place was generally dirty, dust on top of the TV, random bits of food lodged tight spaces, random bits missing like batteries from the back from the TV remote.2. Mold and mildew in the bathroom with no effort to clean it up so taking a shower will make you feel dirtier.3.The fire detectors were removed from the room by the host for their convince so the place smelt like incense and cheep perfume( see point 5 for why) 4. Both the chairs in the room were broken meaning the only place to sit was the bed and there was no way to eat at the table.5. One of the other guest was a clearly a prostitute seeing clients who they hurriedly tried to get in or out of their room and hanged out side waiting at day and night.I ended up calling my Girlfriend and asking her not to come she wasn't pleased, but I explained just how bad it was and she understood.I'm currently dealing with AirBnB customer help and I'm not feeling happy about it they don't care the place was a mess only thing they care about is the fact that there was a prostitute.I'm going to have to rent a actual hotel room now to get some sleep as last night was horrible. Do yourself a favour and book a hotel if you have an issue they will deal with it on the spot."

To cement the fears that my family had when we got in to the apartment the public areas were in verry poor shape and the apartment had an extra heavy door with not one but four serious locks. This was not a safe place to be.I dont know how you can avoid this situation it is I suppose the risk you take when using a service like Airbnb. To add insult to injury Airbnb were down when I cancelled meaning that I could not cancel until after the 2pm on the second day. As a result I received a refund of €106 out of €530 spent. Needless to say we moved to a more appropriate accomodation the next day. Airbnb were unhelpfull, I opened a support case before the deadline to let them know I was trying to cancel but the app wasnt working. This made no difference they left it up to the host to decide and of course he declined. My fault I did not write a review on Airbnb which then gave the host an opertunity to slate me. Bottom line I am cancelling my Airbnb account and will inform my contact sphere about the dangers of booking on this site."

During our last stay we found a truck and trailer completely blocking the only steep gravel road from our cabin. We were literally held hostage for a day as the host nor airbnb would do anything to to remove this truck with no one around it. A security complaint with photos and detailed airbnb host messages showing she could care less were sent to airbnb. Weeks later airbnb sided with the host and said there were no security concerns and closed the case. I will be filing in Small Claims court shortly. Airbnb is a joke.

Taking money before a booking is agreed with the host is unethical and has left me extremely disappointed as I now can’t go on my trip because of how they operate.

My first stay was in Canada and my bed smelled of urine. The host tried to blame that on a plumbing issue... I know what plumping issues smell like vs pee on a mattress. I didn't complain to airbnb since it was my first stay and I felt awkward complaining more about it.With my 2nd stay, Issues started when I changed the stay from 4 people to 3 the cost went from $34 to $630.... when I came in the ""private"" room (was not really private as stated, only separated by a curtain) the room had someone else's things in there and was completely dirty which led to the last minute emergency stay, stay number 3. I had to find another airbnb right away as it was getting late and they would not cover the additional cost difference and refused to cover the cost of a hotel for that 1 night. Place 3 was the only nice place I had a good experience, thanks to the lovely understanding host. The 4th stay also was not as described causing me to spend more money on items that were supposed to be included. There wasn't even any TP or pool towels!! After reading more into the reviews for place #4 you can tell the host replaces the title and pictures and keeps the reviews so the reviews didn't even go to that place. At the time I was given 2 coupons for these last experiences which didn't even cover the cost of the emergency move (extra transportation cost and loss of time) and the lack of items supplied at the 4th place, the value of the coupons were $20 & $25. Those coupons expired during Covid, May 2020. I requested to be able to use them again for my current new stay and they abosolutely refused to honor the coupons or issue me new ones to replace them. Even though it was Covid they told me people still traveled so they won't honor that either. After my horrible experience with airbnb and their customer service I am done. Seeing here the average is 1.5 stars, I'm not surprised..."

Contacted airbnb for help, constantly had to call them back to request follow up because no one ever did anything more than sending me the standard ""I'm on your case"" message and then radio silence. Was told by airbnb to NOT REBOOK until they got back to me, and their agent told me she PROMISE they would cover the price difference between my old booking and the new one I had to book due to cancelation so I shouldn't stress over prices going up every hour, I sent them the cheapest options I found (several listings every day) and they failed to respond in a timely manner therefore everything was booked. Now they're telling me 2 days before I leave that they will not cover what they promised, now that all even remotely affordable options are booked and all that's available are twice the price of my original booking. Remember they take a percentage of each booking made and you'll see why this company makes money - forcing prices up, trapping customers and lying to you in customer service.All around a horrible experience from a horrible company.

336,Kalli Sonnenburg,US,1 review,"Thursday, November 4, 2021, 02:47:15 AM",1,Unsafe venue and horrible customer service!!,"A group of us rented an airbnb in Nashville for a girls weekend. Looking at the pictures and reviews online, we booked our trip and were looking forward to it. The house was relatively new to airbnb, looked very clean and well taken care of, and the owners were relatively responsive to our questions before out stay. When we got to the venue at our check-in time, everything changed. We opened the door to a very filthy and unkempt house. The sheets on the beds were not cleaned before we arrived, as we found hair, stains, and hair bands when we pulled the sheets back. There were stains on the walls from what looked like killing bugs, stains on the carpets and the furniture, dead flies in the showers, dried urine on the toilet seats, rotting garbage in the garage, old food in the fridge and pantry, a child's diaper in the kitchen drawer, a front door that did not fit properly in the frame, and a broken door knob on the balcony entrance, not to mention the fact that the house was in a questionable neighborhood. We contacted the owners no more than 30 minutes after our arrival about the uncleanliness of the place and they told us that they were sorry and that they would send someone immediately to remedy the situation. We waited 2 hours without any other communication and contacted them again to ask about the status of the cleaning team. They again told us someone would be out to clean. About 2 hours after that, the doorbell rang and when we opened it, there was a large trash bag sitting on the step. No note. No person. Just a trash bag filled with bed linens that may or may not have been cleaned. We again contacted the owners with no response and then immediately contacted airbnb. The representative was less than helpful and in the end, told us that we needed to have contacted airbnb within 24 hours of our arrival time (which we did) in order to be eligible for a refund. Needless to say, we vacated the house that night and ended up paying to stay in a hotel for the weekend. We were not refunded a cent from this experience because we failed to notify airbnb within 24 hours of our arrival, which again is completely false. We spent $2550 on an unsafe and unhealthy venue that we spent a total of 4 hours at and were not even listened to or cared about as a paying customer by the owners of the venue or airbnb as a whole. None of us will likely use airbnb ever again."
337,Jay N.,US,1 review,"Tuesday, November 2, 2021, 08:11:08 PM",1,My experience with this organization…,"My experience with this organization was not good. My neighbor decided to rent her apartment as an Airbandb. The person she rented her apt to, through Airbandb, brought a large, loud, aggressively barking dog with him, which disrupted multiple tenants in our building for 3 days straight. The barking, which was violently loud, continued non-stop for an unrelenting 10-12 hours during the day. As someone who works from home, needless to say, the noise and stress this caused was palpable. I reached out to Airbandb and followed their outlined instructions to make a complaint. The response I received, via email, was ridiculous. The person who responded to my complaint was named Kelly, and she informed me that I should ""contact the host directly"" about my complaint. Why does Airbandb even HAVE guidelines to lodge a complaint about a host using their service, if all they're able to do is respond with the words, ""Talk to them yourself""?! This made little sense, so I responded that I had no such contact info, and clearly the host was not there--that's why they were able to rent out their apt in the first place, because they are NOT AT HOME. Somehow the Airbandb employee seems to have not thought of that. I was gracious and patient in my follow-up to Kelly, yet her second and final response was to simply tell me that she could not provide any contact info for me and that, in her words, ""This matter is now considered closed."" Wow. So not only was I dismissed and not offered any guidance on a very big and immediate problem, but curt rudeness was added into the mix, disguised in a business-like, formal tone. Again I ask--why does Airbandb even offer a place to lodge a complaint if they are only going to tell someone to talk to the person who uses their company themselves? (Side note: I left notes on the apt door and tried to knock and speak to the person staying there who had the loud animal-- and so did other neighbors. It was all we could do. They never answered their door. That's when I contacted Airbandb, to no avail.) I would not call this organization exactly helpful, by any stretch, and I'd be very concerned to discover anyone who lives near you might be using this service. If any problems of noise or aggressive animals arise, Airbandb will pass the buck right back to you. Be prepared."

So far, it's been more than 2 years trying to get our money back, not to mention over 10 hours of wasted time. To make it worse we are a Superhost and Airbnb still does not care. Just worse than horrible."

Informed the operative named Bruno that the fact AirBnB was refusing to help was a disgraceful way to treat its hosts, and I was surprised that people weren't deactivating their accounts immediately if this was how hosts were being treated, his response ""would you like me to go ahead and deactivate your account?"" To which of course I was surprised and asked for a supervisor call back and how I would go about raising a complaint against him...but...did you know and I quote ""AirBnB does not accept complaints?"" Multinational company who doesn't protect the people who make them money, and doesn't accept complaints...impressive"

When there is an issue, air bnb agents have no clue how to help. Business model ensures you call (a robot in Asia will answer), they read from a script, they cannot deviate from the script, and they spend the conversation telling you how sorry they are they can’t help before telling you someone from different department will call you back- a call back that NEVER happens.2) when they transfer you to an agent higher up - they all cannot help you and will never call you back. In addition if you ask to escalate to manager, the agent told me this was bad idea as it takes between 3-5 days for managers for respond. What kind of way to run a business is this?3) I called every day for 6 weeks screaming for them to release my payments. Each time I rang, agents had no clue why I was calling despite me requesting they make notes of the call in my file? They don’t record calls, and there is no hierarchy, I just got passed around from robot to robot - no one has any authority to do anything. And they just want you off the call.4) no time scales for resolution. For 6 weeks (still ongoing) they told me every day they couldn’t give me a time when my payments (over £2,000 at that point) would be released. The agents say ‘you just have to wait for the future and when we can fix it’ can you believe that? I said transfer me through to the resolution department dealing with this, they basically told me agents can’t ring or email them, and no one has any way of contacting them??? Resolution team is like a secret James Bond 077 team living under ground in Guadalajara- untouchable and uncontactable . This issue remains in going . No one takes ownership of anything, and your helpless. You can’t even go to OFCOM, so you really are alone with mindless endless phone calls with script readers who have no idea how to help.Air bnb needs to look at this. Worst customer service in the history of the planet. Their genius creators are sitting on an island drinking cocktails , content their support service is ****, because it must be the cheapest ever.I feel bad for hosts just about to start contacting air bnb for support, be prepared for a very long Rocky road. It’s made me also think about if I ever needed to claim. I will just have to fix it, the stress of dealing with the robots would tip anyone over the edge.Now looking at what other providers I can use. Grace"

We then rang customer service who long story short said they had made a mistake and not put our order through and weren’t expecting us. They said they would find alternative accommodation for us and we are still waiting to hear from them. We have had to travel all the way home, which airbnb clearly couldn’t care less about so we have been totally messed about. We were promised a refund so we could get another place and still haven’t had confirmation. So have been left high and dry so now we have lost out festival tickets money and haven’t had a refund.

I contacted Airbnb to request they reverse these charges and they adamantly refused. The initial customer service representative I spoke to was useless and then told me she would get me a supervisor within 24 to 48 hours, which never happened. After five days I again insisted on speaking to a supervisor, (I swear I’m not a Karen!) And after a brief text message from said supervisor basically they told me to kick rocks. I will never, ever, ever use Airbnb again. I have booked with Vrbo numerous times and never had the issues that I have with Airbnb. It’s too bad because the properties we have used through them have always been great but the company sucks"

After back and forthing with customer service a few times, it became clear to me that it was a waste of my time to attempt to use the credit or even to solicit customer service's help in using it.I consider this 'fake credit' to be an unprofessional and sleazy act on the part of airbnb."

The end of the story was that neither GuestService nor Airbnb took any responsibility for material and immaterial damages by us.

I immediately contacted Airbnb for help. Deleted the listing ans changed password but BOOM, the listing was back up the next morning. I again contacted Airbnb and also went to their forum to take the issue out there in hopes it would wake someone up but the only thing that happened was I was blocked from my own account. Probably the hackers still manage my account where I’m not allowed anymore? Maybe it was not good publicity for Airbnb when I went to their forum to address the issue? Luckily I have screenshots of all actions and even a log where I can see from which countries my account had been accessed. Needless to say, all my personal info is on my account as well as my credit card details. Today I got an email from Airbnb saying they checked the account and that it’s a gif thing I changed my password?!

I rented an airbnb for 8 months in San Francisco, thinking that I’d have peace and I’d be able to focus on my new job. But it was the very opposite. I have had a couple of issues with the house listing and tried to solved them in a nice way with the host who was being very responsive. But One day we heard a noise in the kitchen and in the morning we figured that there was a mice there. Once again contacted the host who came to try to solve the problem, we were hoping that that mouse was a isolated case. He also scheduled a terminx to come and do an inspection. My husband and I were being understanding and patient, but after the terminx come and told us the mice were living on the walls of the kitchen we just wanted to leave that place asap. I contacted airbnb and I had a long journey explaining my situation, but the company doesn’t seem to care. I had already spent over 8k in 2 months and all airbnb gave me was a credit of $150. We weren’t able to find a new place with the same size and price as we needed. I tried several times explaining the whole situation but apparently if you’re not PHD in Airbnb rules, you’re screwed!! So guess what?! I’m not phd at airbnb and the company insisted they could do nothing because I didn’t report the case in 24h. I got punished and lost money for trying to solve the problem in a civilized way and understanding the host side. After all my case was forwarded for a different ambassador who texted me at about 11pm and closed my case at 3am because I didn’t respond him. But guess what Airbnb, I work early in the morning so I sleep early, I’m not phd at aibnb rules and I’m not available 24/7 for airbnb. We finally got a deal directly with the host to have at least a small percentage back, but guess what again?! The percentage doesn’t include the part that goes to airbnb so we got even less money back. I try to assume best intentions from everyone and everything, but expecting good intensions from airbnb was a big mistake. Even knowing of all the trouble I went through the company didn’t give anything back. So I lost, the host lost and airbnb keep making millions over other people’s property and guests that make the mistake to trust the intentions of this company. The only good intentions that I can see is from some of the Ambassadors, that have to deal with the mess caused by this company."

We also have an AirBnB and are superhosts, and before they would help me they wanted all sorts of info including the last four digits of my bank account. Really? To book a house? It's obvious that their customer service is not in the US, as the person was hard to understand and I had to give her my name multiple times before she figured out I was the right person. The booking I was attempting wouldn't accept either of two charge cards, both of which are paid in full and I've recently used without issue, and she was no help. She told me to call the charge card company, but I had already checked online and saw that their were no issues with the cards. Calling customer support was a waste of time."

They will let the host deal with it. If you encounter a cold hearted inconsiderate host you will not get your money back. A total robbery. I booked a place more than a month in advance. I understand that the host has a 48hr after booking policy. But something came up and had to cancel. First you can message the host to consider the situation. But if you get unlucky, host will reason out about the policy you will never get a full refund. The host has gotten your money just like that. Airbnb will not interfere with this situation. Goodbye to your hard earned money."

Great news we thought and gave them good feedback.    We arranged for our things to be taken to Reception so we could drive back and collect them. The next day we rang Bowland Fell Reception who stated that no items had been handed in.  We contacted the host again who confirmed yes the items had been put into the cleaners van and subsequently ''thrown away''.  Totally amazed and disgusted with this - contacted Airbnb who were as much use as a chocolate teapot to put it politely and more of less said as we left them it was not their responsibility and it was our fault.

Complaints to Airbnb were either handled by a bot, or they have a standard response. Even after I told them I did not want the cleaning fee, I got a standard response and it is being deposited. Their terms and conditions favor them and their hosts down to limiting the window to review the property. They’ve lost a customer.

But I feel future guests should be aware of 266 Basque rd. we stayed from October 13-18. Although Maria had great communication and tried to help,  unfortunately, it's a shame that such a beautiful place that could have so much potential, wasn't taken care of. The outside appearance was very disappointing when we pulled up and the inside was deceiving. The lawn was over grown and weeds covered whatever landscaping was there. Trash all around the yard and we had no place to put our garbage because all the bins were full from the previous folks.  Inside looks great at first, but needs a ton of work and up keep. So much happened over the week we stayed. It was a Military Vet Reunion after 20 years and the very expensive cakes I bought got covered with ants. Some of us didn't get to have any. The kitchen would have ants on counters, a couple roaches and a sink that wouldn't drain. Really bad mold in master bathroom. Paint from the ceiling fell down to where my kids were playing also along with more ants and roaches were on the floor. The ants got into the dog food.Why did we continue to stay you might ask? I had been planning this reunion for my husband and his buddies for months. They were all coming from all over at different days and times. I wasn't about to have them and their families repack and move after long flights and drives. I even had to stay there all day and wait on a plumber while the guests went out. After waiting, and even though Maria tried, I was told no one can come out til the next day. I wasn't about to waist my planned trip because folks couldn't do their job.  Fortunately, one of our friends fixed the sink.As I understand that some things can not be for seen, some of these issues didn't happen over night. If her and her people were doing their job, it would have been taken care of prior to our PLANNED vacation. I had asked to stay an extra night just so I could have time to clean and check all of our belongings for ants and roaches. Another waisted day but I didn't want to bring that into my clean home. As soon as an issue was noticed, I contacted Maria immediately along with photos.  I asked for at least one night's refund.  I gave up on her after a while of back and forth and contacted Airbnb directly and got the cleaning fee refunded. I have photos, videos and messages of everything. 266 Basque Rd has so much potential in a gorgeous town and it's becoming a dump. I hope this helps them turn that place around so others can enjoy the vacation they planned in advance. Don't let the description and photos fool you like it fooled me. We've stayed at places before. This was awful. Wish I could have left a more positive review."

One hour before take off, my airline delayed my flight before canceling 30 min later. They rebooked me for two days later. The Airbnb host would not let me change my dates or give a refund despite things being out of my control. He said "" sorry, I can't, I do this for a living"". He's all about the money and inflexible. They refunded me $230, keeping $420 for nothing. The host is Gerardo Y Maria in Miami Florida. Airbnb said they would do a full refund but did not."

At this point Airbnb is totally absent, we’ve been 7 hours trying to figure out a new accommodation, continuously calling Airbnb support. They never found a solution. Their suggestion was just to search for a new place and they would try to contact them with the emergency number that they have, but most of the work was on us. The most absurd thing was that while searching an agent told us that his shift was over and someone else would’ve taken our case. Obviously, nobody did and we had to call back the support. Eventually, we decided to book a hotel as an emergency, we asked for a refund for this hotel and they gave us back just 50%, but they never suggested us this option. This money arrived after a month and another call because they forgot to tell us that in order to receive the money you need to have a payout method set on the account. In short, their customer support, especially in case of emergency is a joke"

When someone from Air B and B finally called, in response to my increasingly urgent texts, the upshot was that they were sorry but there was nothing they could do but issue a refund.  This occurred on a busy week-end with local hotels largely booked up.  I was a repeat user of Air B and B, with excellent owner feedback, but after experiencing Air B and B’s customer non-support I will think very carefully about renting through Air B and B in the future.

They put their greed for profit ahead of guest safety.I rented a condo in Houston that had german Cockroaches in the wall. The host knew this and never disclosed this. The host accepted my reservation on 8/23 then had the place treated on 8/26, with future treatments needed. My arrival was on 9/5 and on the 3 morning I seen Cockroach coming out of the sink. Then I notice smaller cockroaches in the shower which blended into the dark shower tile. Plus I noticed smaller cockroaches coming out of the cracks in the floor trim. By no means was this place safe to rent out or live in. The host knew all of this as she texted me on 9/8 a screen shot of the service the exterminator did on her condo. Which also indicated future treatment in 2 weeks based on scheduling availability. The Cockroach Condo host had no problem NOT disclosing any of this to the Guest, me.Airbnb, customer support was the worst I have ever dealt with. The constantly have me orbital dialog and would not give me honest answers. I requested multiple times to have my case escalated up to higher management, but then again they played games with me and would never let me work with upper management. The customer support reps I dealt would could not speak clear english and talked in a foreign tone. Their understanding of meaning of words didn’t make sense at all. They made mistakes and charged my credit card higher amounts to confuse the situation. I requested a full refund as the place was not SAFE to live in from the first day. Not to mention all my personal property was exposed to German COCKROACHES to spread Cockroaches to any new place I travel to. I spend days treating my personal property to kill any cockroaches that crawled into my clothes, boxes, and personal items. I put up a review on the Cockroach Condo and called out the host for knowing she had cockroaches and was a dishonest person for not disclosing this. AirBnB, took down my review and would not let me post a new one. AirBnB put this host ahead of guest safety as they believe their GREED for profit is more important. I went round and round with a customer service rep, but they claim its the RULES of AirBnB to not let me post a new review. So people, the REVIEW are not honest and you can’t trust them as AirBnB take down the negative reviews.I requested a breakdown what I was charged, but again I got orbital dialog and never received breakdown of what I was charged. I should have gotten a FULL REFUND, but AirBnB is greedy and sided with the COCKROACH CONDO host. How sick is this???3045 Walnut Bend Ln, Houston, TX 77042 I book another place in Rockport, which had cockroaches too. I never enter that place again either.AirBnB has Host that know they have cockroaches.Who want to rent a place that has cockroaches in it?

If I don´t know what´s the problem with this listing, the new listing will be blocked too.I have already read all the tutorials and I am an experience-host since two years. I would like to know why this new experience was declinedHIGH FEES AND MISSING PAYOUTSI have always loved airbnb both as a guest or host, regardless the fact that they get about 20% of commissions and that this percentage is hidden.As a host I have the following experience:Airbnb has issued several times payouts with lower amounts than the one shown in the booking.I start to think that they do it in purpose.This is actually a fraud and makes me not trust Airbnb anymore.- POSITIVE -AIRBNB REPRESENTS THE FAIR TRADE FOR TRAVELThere are so many empty homes and rooms in the world that we would not need hotels at all and even homeless would have always a space.The speculation and the destructive business approach of hotels is in fact one of the cause of the global crisis: the most of the money goes in the pocket of few (hotel owners) and to serve just a small elite (rich people that can afford Hotels).Not to mention that Hotels are not environmental, social or cultural friendly, often tourists are 'stored' in hotels where they alienate themselves from reality in lux and superficiality.HELPING PEOPLE WITH LITTLE INCOMES AND EVEN HOMELESSAirbnb is actually preventing homelessness by giving people with low incomes the possibility to share some spaces and costs.Often airbnb fills the gaps in the institutional welfare system.SOLUTION FOR MEDIUM TERM ACCOMMODATIONFor those who travel few months for  business, study or other projects, Airbnb represents the best solution, offering a great platform where to get to know your host.- REMARKS -BUGS IN THE LISTINGSIf I set specific filters in the search, I can't find my own listing even though I do have those options researched.I have contacted the Airbnb customer service (which was not so well prepared) and still the issue happens.I am thinking to switch to VRBO or HousingAnywhere cause this issue is preventing me from getting bookedBugs in calendar: I just have got a booking that has a date in the past (last year).UNCLEAR PAYMENTSThe payments that you get via the bank are hard to recognize for which booking they are:the amount is not exactly the same like the one on the ""reservation"" page and there is no guest's name on the transaction's details.TOO HIGH FEESThe fees are sometimes above 10%, that's too much, but I see that also that international bank transaction may cost a lot to AirBnb.NO NEGATIVE REVIEWS?There are never negative reviews, how is it possible?! Please be honest and make people choose to review: Positive/Neutral/NegativeMORE FAIR PRICED SUBLETS PLEASEThe market prices of sublets are much lower than the one you find on AirBnb- FEATURES REQUEST - LAST-MINUTE PRICES FOR EXPERIENCES(for hosts)Possibility for an experience's host, to add a last-minute low price in order to avoid experiences with only one or two attendees, which are not enjoyable for the participants neither.EMAIL ALERTWould be nice to have automated emails alert for properties matching your criteria.CREDITS SYSTEM / PAYMENTSPlease create a feature where you can choose to not get paid with money, but with credits that you can accumulate to travel yourself.Like on HomeExchange, where you DON'T NEED LEGAL PERMISSION from the institutions to rent and DON'T HAVE ISSUES WITH TAXES DECLARATION, because you are not getting paid.

I have accommodated them on a number of occasions (on behalf of their guests - requests came via Airbnb).  I needed to cancel a booking 7 months in advance due to concerns about reopening - I didn't realise our listing had become live again (it was paused for a number of months due to Covid etc.).  I cancelled within minutes of the booking being made.  I explained to Airbnb our concerns that our business may not reopen next year due to the impact of Covid etc.  They insisted on fining me and penalizing me. I have now left the Airbnb platform for good. We have provided such good service over the years and have always been flexible - we have not charged people for cancelling and we have really gone beyond on many occasions. To be treated like this is quite simply not how we want to do business - with anyone.  I won't use this service again - to advertise or to find accommodation. I have dealt with other accommodation listing companies and received better and more understanding service.

Only to find out that I would have to share the place with my friends and other people on a special occasion!!!!!!Now the host has ran off with my money , does not reply to my messages text calls and even the support teams messages whatsoever. I have been complaining for the past week in regards to receiving a refund and the support escalation team have been no help whatsoever. If you would good service and to receive a refund from this company don’t bother - I have had to raise a dispute with my bank in order to receive the refund. Imagine it’s only a deposit coming from my hard earned money, and they are moving very displeasing. It was my first time using this platform and it’ll be my last. Even whilst looking at other apartments to change to, a host listed a fake apartment to scam people and I had to report it. How is it that I could realised within a millisecond that a post was fraud but , it checked the criteria and went through to being uploaded onto the site. Paloma - escalations team: is unprofessional and takes a very long time to reply to the emails I’ve sent her. Does not lift a finger to even try and attempt to give a refund. What she is doing is what I’ve been doing - getting in touch with the host and no response. The check to even say I would have to arrive to the location on the day of check in and then the team will be able to do something about this case. If you think for a second that , I’ll leave my house and bring my friends to place where the host does not reply and share the accom with other people - so something can go wrong. This platform is very untrustworthy and what I just said has no logic to it. I even called someone from another team , and he was literally laughing at me being upset at the fact that this situation is distressing me. He said that there’s nothing he can do (initially), and I ask for an email or to speak with the head of his or the escalation team department and he did not do anything that I asked him to do. All he said was that he’ll speak to paloma for me and I bet you that won’t be done. All I want is my money back it’s that simple. So whoever will see this , forward this claim to the head of your department. Take the host off the listing because , she is ruining your rep.  And I would like an email to the complaints team.

I feel that since a small guy like me or you that want to advertise your host to make money in a decent way you will on their site. However, they charged me $100 penalty cuz i want to cancel my guest booking cuz my guest book an hour prior to check in time and want to check in early and since i am on instant booking then they booked this guest which supposedly my out going guest will be staying but opted to checked out early booked. So then my calendar kicked in as available and my cleaners got covid symptoms that won’t be able to clean ASAP so guests opted to stay somewhere else. As i tried not to charged guests if they checked out early as i feel if i charged them its a ripoff but airbnb does rip-off by charging me about this cancellation. This in-humane. Airbnb does not have consideration at all! PLEASE HOST AND GUESTS STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. You don’t have no idea how you get ripped off. You cannot call ASAP, poor design app, bad business!

Generally a good experience, at least decent. Last Christmas I booked a month stay in Capetown SA. It was a total disaster. Here is why I specifically DON’T recommend Airbnb for long stays.1. Long stays have a totally separate refund policy. That is, basically none. Unless you booked many months, you won’t see a penny back from the service if anything goes wrong.2. Superhost is a meaningless designation. It has to do mostly with how fast a host responds to an inquiry, and really little to do with actually being great at hospitality. In my case the hostess was a “superhost” despite having fewer than a dozen reviews and clearly some of those were from friends.3. Since most reviews are written by people who stay for very short times, they are of little help to the long stayer. What makes a place great for an extended stay is mostly the personality of the host and how much they make you feel at home. Someone who stays 24 hours talks about the mattress and how clean the bathroom is.4. Some problems will arise after a few days of living with someone. Airbnb only protects you for the first 24 hours of your stay, after that it’s all on you. In my case, I didn’t love my hostess (she seemed strange) but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and by the time I complained to Airbnb and opened a support case, they first wasted my time for days and then eventually said it was too late to help.5. Because of the unique nature of the platform it’s impossible to get any objective information. Each host is kept secret until you book, so there is no way to check the internet for other reviews, etc.In summary, I think it’s fine to use Airbnb for very short term stays but definitely avoid using for monthly stays. You can find better options through vrbo, booking, agoda homes, and often Facebook groups have monthly rentals.Good luck!"

I posted a review talking about my issues.  Airbnb Decided to remove it.  Saying that ""We understand that this might not be what you’d hoped for"" but that they would still be removing my review.1) the plumbing was not finished in the main bath, 2) the shower curtain was still in a box, 3) almost all of the towels were still in plastic packaging (not washed) 4) 2 rooms did not have light bulbs 5) 1 room did not have a fire detector - just wires hanging from the ceiling.  There were several other inconsistencies in the listing. Still Airbnb Decided that did not warrant a bad review!  I am no lingers Airbnb fan.  They do not care about the customer just the people that provide them a product to rent - no mater how bad."

Don't trust them if you need a refund.Context: I have 8 excellent reviews as a guest. The 9th visit was unsatisfactory (less rooms than advertised, very dirty apartment, burning plastic smell). It was likely A DRUG HOUSE. I had to leave the place immediately and pay for separate accommodation.I tried all the channels to get a refund. (request refund immediately from host, contacted Airbnb support immediately and continuously for 4 days).J** in Support took 16! days to respond. By then I had disputed the charge on my credit card. She was apologetic ""It came to our attention that you had an accuracy issue in your previous reservation and we can't apologize enough for this inconvenience. We are here to help you.""5 days later, Airbnb lied and supplied the bank with false information, conveniently omitting the support agent's admission of guilt and so the dispute was wrongly closed. I reopened the dispute ~5 days later.After another 3 weeks of waiting, the dispute was closed again. So finally after much wrangling on the phone with the bank, the bank agreed to a refund.Airbnb refused to refund the bank, and has been extremely uncooperative. A truly unjust company. Take your business elsewhere if you can. Vrbo for example."

Unknowing that this advert was fake, I booked, and when I turned up at the door at 9.30pm in the pitch black in an unknown city, I had the door slammed in my face and nowhere to stay.Called up customer support who told me I had to wait 30 mins for the host to respond to them before they could cancel. Got to 10pm and the guy who was helping me changed shifts, and promised someone would take over him as it was now very late at night and I still had nowhere to stay. No one took over from him despite my pleading messages to customer support.In the mean time, I had to book a last minute hotel, which cost me £114 as I had no other options.

423,Dana Noya,GB,2 reviews,"Monday, October 4, 2021, 10:34:29 PM",1,Rewarding abusive behaviour and not guaranteeing safety,"My friend and I used Airbnb for the first time this year. We got a flat in Mykonos with no wifi and no washing machine (even though description said they were included); and we got an abusive and aggressive host on our second stay. The situation with the second host got so out of hand that they first recommended us to leave the hotel because “safety comes first” and then proceeded to follow up with an investigation where we had to call them every week (otherwise we would not hear back from them), provide them with all the information they kept requesting, recounting our harrowing experience over and over, to just not get any type of refund a month later. We called to ask the basis of their decision and they never explained it. We kept saying no rational women would leave a hotel at midnight, without staying one night, and pay another two hotels out of pocket if there weren’t an issue. By doing so, they promote and reward aggressive and abusive behaviour as well as making it blatantly clear that they do not care about the security of their guests nor do they guarantee it. Considering my first experience, I think it is a lot safer (and a lot less expensive), to book hotels or using websites like Expedia or Booking.com where at least your safety is guaranteed. I have never been more scared in my entire life and I really could not regret dealing with Airbnb more"

Seems they cater to the troublesome guests over the SUPER HOSTS! I've had damage done and they would not make the guest cover costs and I had to absorb the cost. And now the final straw that broke the camels back was when a woman from russia instant booked my place and then when I asked her for clarification on her needs she ignored my messages and so I called airbnb and they said i could cancel and so I did and then she had her friend from russia try to make a booking and he had a 1.5 rating so I canceled him and then she began messaging me ands doing so in the middle of the night waking us both up and disrupting our sleep.  I then made it clear to them that I was not going to be bullied and forced to take a booking I was uncomfortable with and so my only option that I felt I had left was to just not accept any booking from russia. So, for that I am told I am discriminating which they would not tolerate. But I just can not let troublesome people who have already caused damage to come into my home and risk damages and then they go back to russia and I am left to fix my place up again at my cost! So they obviously prefer to cater to the troublesome guests rather than protect a 5 STAR HOST!  And this is by a company with a 1.4 rating!!! I only wish I could give NO STARS to this report.  I could go on for another hour telling of the other issues that I have had to deal with because of their lack of concern for the SUPER HOSTS but this will have to do.  They are the pits!"

The apartment was acceptable, and because we wanted to enjoy the vacation we tried to let go. We didn't have hot water for 5 days. We have tried to contact the owner since day 2, there was great lack of communication and support. We then contacted Airbnb, which declined to help and said that after 24 hours of check in is basically your problem. Issue is that the owner was a 3rd party company handling hundreds of apartments, we specifically asked them to come in the flat when we were in, to fix the hot water. One night coming back from dinner, we found the door unlocked, the terrace window unlocked and the owner that went in without letting us know (we had a whatsapp chat for the duration of the stay). I cannot recommend less the customer service from Airbnb. I have left already a big complain, they came back to me with the same answer. I am embraced for them, I can't believe they let that happen and not even suggest a goodwill gesture.For one night we have slept with chairs against the doors as we were petrified that they would have broken in again. I can't believe how careless they have been."

You will fall for these pictures and think that these places are great. They sometimes are but more often than not you will fall victim to these places being far from nice and clean. You will reach out to airbnb only to find out they will leave you on your own to sort out your own problems that should never have been there in the first place. If you book high end expensive places you will not fall prey to these tactics but if you're always looking for a good deal what you think might be a good deal might just be a HUGE HEADACHE that you will have to deal with on your own. I wish that airbnb would be more helpful and responsive but in my recent interactions they have not been helpful at all. Book carefully because it's on you.

For starters the cabin looks absolutely nothing like it does in the photos. As the men were trying to go back outside to get the bag, we noticed the inside knob/latch on the door was broken and had been neatly placed back on. We were told there were 2 sleep sofas, so we lifted the cushions on both sofas and noticed there was only one, and the loveseat had popcorn down it. But wait that’s not it!! My son noticed games up by the bar and proceeded to get into bar stool to sit and it just like the door was broken and had been neatly placed. At 5:12 pm I reach out to Terry the owner and let him know if all of our findings per @airbnb and the told me to give him an hour to respond. During this hour, someone went to the restroom and washed their hand and the sink was stopped up afterwards. After an hour we call Airbnb and they try to get ahold of the host and say they would call us back. We waiting and I’m between kept calling and the could not get ahold of the host either. It’s getting later and darker and we talk to multiple people in between time and no one at Airbnb was helpful and the kept telling us oh it’s the end of my shift and I will pass your case to someone else. But let me put the icing on the cake!!! After being too late to leave and Airbnb not willing to help us relocate to a better cabin we decided we will go to sleep and just wake up this morning and leave. They go to pull out the bed on the sleep sofa and it was FILLED with Rat Poop and Pee. At this point I’m mad, I texted the host once again with pictures this time of the rat droppings and I say Rat Poop in the sleep sofa. He decided to respond to me at 2:56 am saying “What do you want us to do”? So yeah whatever you do don’t book this cabin. And I won’t be using Airbnb again either. The did give a full refund that they told me will take 7-10 business days to be back into my account."

Really stupid of Airbnb to force that without warning. Afterwards I went on to customer support chat. I asked two simple questions: Why me, why now?Friends of mine do not need to go through ID verification, so something must have triggered it. After chatting for more than 30 minutes and being copy-paste spammed with various excerpts from their policy -none of which answered my questions- I decided to call it a day.I was a loyal customer of Airbnb for many years and have many extremely positive reviews from the hosts I stayed at. That probably counts in terms of trust (that Airbnb so value) more than any ID verification. But this is coming to an end, after being treated like this by Airbnb.Airbnb used to be like the Apple of location renting: Unique and high-quality for a premium price.But now it's just the same crappy service that their competitors offer too. I will therefore also revert to use booking.com or one of the Airbnb clones: It's the same bad service, but there's no sudden ID verification causing me headaches."

The reservation very clearly stated that I had 48 hours to cancel for a full refund so I confirmed with the bride and booked because the houses out there go very quickly. Unfortunately, some of the bridal party felt that Palm Springs did not fit into their budget, so we made a pivot (within the day) and moved the venue and cancelled the reservation. To my surprise, I DID NOT receive a full refund. AirBnb decided to keep their $600 service fee. When I spoke to customer service I was told that this was not refundable to prevent double booking (which is semi-understandable if I hadn’t canceled in under a day), and I was given a link to fine print about the service fee that would have been 5 clicks deep for me to find. I honestly feel tricked and on top of that, the issue was not resolved. I suppose I learned a valuable lesson, but maybe it would also be beneficial for AirBnb to be clearer with their policies up front rather than burying them through 20 minutes of reading."

You will lose your money and your peace of mind!!I booked a place for one night (thank God) and we got there at night after driving. The street was super dark, the main gate to access the property had a lock and of course no key for it, there was supposedly a second gate that was part of the wooden fence so you can imagine how heavy that thing looked plus it was in the middle of tall grass so no thank you.We ended up leaving and sleeping on a creepy cheap road motel that had a room available for the night. Imagine how unsafe we felt trying to get into our Airbnb that we preferred the creepy motel.Customer service responded 36 days later of my claim to say that they were closing the case because the host didn't approve the refund because the gate was opened. LOL. What a joke!!! BTW, as part of the process you have to request the refund to your host first and after it gets declined (72 hours) is when you get access to contact customer service...not before. When they closed my case, they said I didn't report it in the first 24 hours. I'm never ever going back on an airbnb!!"

Not good value for money and I strongly advise you to spend elsewhere where you are guranteed good service."

Unfortunately, that was a mistake.Booked an expensive but nice-looking property for an August getaway, in Devon (Large Characteristic Farmhouse in Caton, England). The references at the time checked out.Without getting into detail, the property was in an awful condition (dog poo onsite and apparently no cleaning despite Airbnb's 'enhanced clean' Covid-19 'guarantee') and responses to requests were extremely poor. We made the best of the situation and subsequently reported it to Airbnb after we had departed.Airbnb appeared to lose the report we submitted, only following it up when we somehow tracked down a phone number. They then claimed it was too late, refused to refund us directly and attempted to gently persuade the host into a voluntarily refund - he responded to neither their messages, nor ours.The whole experience was entirely amateur and shows why Airbnb's reputation and rating on Trustpilot is well deserved. It is a multi-billion dollar company without fit-for-purpose systems and processes for customer safety, and depends on trying to sweet-talk irresponsible hosts.Avoid!"

PayPal investigated and declined my refund saying Airbnb have not given evidence for a refund. Airbnb mentioned that they are investigating further.They just sent me recently a message to say that host does not offer refunds.I mentioned to host in my telephone conversation with him during our booking and he offered to refund me because I explained to him that I had 2 autistic children who were not able to mix with many people and because of that he agreed to let us cancel.He has not responded since and Airbnb are allowing hosts to still money from people without confronting host to let them know that what they are doing is wrong.Whats the point of Airbnb if they can not offer support to their customers when they need help.I am suffering now from depression and anxiety because my 2 autistic children lost their holiday of a life time and Airbnb do not care at all.I have lost so much money and its been stressing me out thinking about it.I would not recommend Airbnb to anyone because of this experience.

We requested a lower temp than 76 degrees, and I asked them to add some warning signs for future tenants since I bumped my head walking down the basement stairs and then stumbled down the two stairs inside the door we didn’t see in the dark. It is crucial to note that these issues were only shared privately. We then gave them a positive public review since they seemed responsive and we slept well enough.Even though we provided that positive review, did not request a refund for the issues encountered, and only shared the issue directly and privately with the hosts, they gave us an extremely negative review highlighting the privately reported issues and calling us both liars and attacking our character. If we were lying, we would have voiced the issues publicly. At no point have we acted in a manner to deserve such treatment. Even in this review, the place and dates are not being shared. Fortunately, in this niche, there are alternatives to AirBNB."

Recently I got alert to verify.It rejected the documents I provided.Inflexible …. I don’t have government id , my driving licence don’t have a pic but I do have a licence for something else that I tried using . Their system don’t accept any of my papers.I opened a case over a month ago. The problem still exist except I am now blocked fromPayout until I can validate myself.Airbnb is of no use as all they keep quoting picture government id or driving licence etc required. It’s automatic they say.I have spoken via message and phone to more than 5 different people on this subject and each one don’t seem to know what has gone on before. Moreover, when they make a reply I have no idea which case they are referring to as there is never a reference in the replies.Conclusion If you are going to use them , be ware that they are acting as introduction only and secondly if you want effect support then this is most likely not the company for you.Good luck as that’s what you will need if partnering with them"

They used the cheapest furniture possbile and honestly the desk and chairs look like they just picked up from a garbage dump. One of the windows is broken. The walls are dirty. It doesn't seem anyone from the host's company ever bothered to take care of the place, only sending cleaning ladies when guests left.

We are a host, managing ~50 properties throughout Central Texas, and until this most recent incident, we'd had all of our properties listed on Airbnb, along with other bookings platforms. They cancel reservations without communicating with the host, or allow the guest to cancel within 24 hours of check-in date, with complete disregard to the host's cancellation policy. The proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back' occured this past weekend. Guest had a reservation on the calendar for a month and was scheduled to check in on Saturday, Sept 18th. On the night of Sept 17th (less than 24 hours prior to check-in), we received notice from Airbnb that the guest had cancelled because ""someone in his group"" had tested positive for Covid. It was NOT the person who made the reservation who suddenly came down with covid, and by law, Airbnb is not even allow for proof, so there was truly no way of confirming that what this person said was true. Instead, Airbnb took their word for it, and refunded more than $2500 with absolutely no recourse for the owner of the home. Airbnb's Extenuating Circumstances policy reads:""Our extenuating circumstances policy is intended to protect guests and hosts from unforeseen circumstances that arise after booking. After the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, the extenuating circumstances policy no longer applies because COVID-19 and its consequences are no longer unforeseen or unexpected."" No where in this policy does it state that a guest should be allowed to cancel, with full refund, based on a positive Test. If Airbnb is going to allow such cancellations, it should mandatory that they require the names of each person traveling so it can then be confirmed that the person who supposedly 'tests positive' is in fact someone in the group scheduled to stay at the home.Airbnb continues, time and time again, to take money from hosts without any thought or consideration!If they truly want to help BOTH parties involved (Travelers and Hosts), two options are:1. Require the traveler to decline travel insurance, with the understanding that they are not entitled to any refund that is outside the host's cancellation policy2. Require the names of each person in the group, so there is SOME accountability when a claim is made that someone tests positive for COVID.As it stands, hosts are left holding the bag. This cancellation costs our owner more than $2500, and our calendar was blocked, preventing anyone else from booking the home, for the month leading up to day of arrival."

Here is a snippet of my live chat with your agent:—-I'm sorry to inform you that my request was denied. As for our policy in this type of situation normally we give a 10% coupon, the only situation where we give up to 50 % is wen the reservation is in less than 24 hours.

They're happy to collect their service fee but when you have to cancel or you have trouble with something if you cancel you don't get your money back. Basically it's great when things go well but when they don't they don't really help you much. Or you contact them and you have to wait and wait and wait. It's really tough because they help you find accommodations pretty much anywhere but they won't protect you much if things don't go as planned.

We paid a deposit of £1,800 in March 21 for a family holiday in Denmark for August 2022.  The second payment of £1400 was scheduled to be taken July 2022. They took the second payment September 4 2021. NO email to say this was being done. The “support team” has given me the run around. We spoken with 3 different people none of whom can deal with our complaint. They want to “investigate “ what’s occurred and frankly this feels like a scam. We’ve paid nearly £4K for a weeks holiday next year and they’re querying everything and making us evidence confirmation of random emails. They Can’t refund the amount which has been taken 10 months before they said & without our consent! BUT they only acknowledge VERBALLY the payments and amounts which have been taken (the second payment is not showing on the online invoice).  Air BNB could take random payments at whim it seems!"

The host, which I contacted inmediately replied he did not know about it and then did not answer any of my messages. Contacted AirBNB “support” which told me that they could request a full refund but only the host can approve it. Few days passed and no response. Contacted “support” again, they said the host read their messages but did not reply and they could not do anything about it. AirBnB support their hosts but nor their guests. Ended up losing $537. I have a dispute with my credit card to get a full refund."

Upon opening the door to our condo, we realized other people were there in our room that had checked in the night prior!! They booked through Airbnb as well!!! We frantically called the host over and over again and received an answering machine. We contacted them through their “messaging service” and they “couldn’t do anything”. They actually recommended we stay at another place through Expedia $300 MORE a night!! We were left stranded, with our kids on Labor Day weekend 10 hours away from our home. It’s been 2 weeks and still NOTHING from the actual host, never talked to an actual person ONCE through “all booked up”. Actually the day after we were supposed to check in we got an “automatic, how are you doing” message!!!And even now as I type this we just received a “hey give us a 5 star review!” Message. We booked this is January, and had been looking forward to it for almost a year. When we contacted Airbnb they kept calling it a “glitch”, and refused to give us the difference that we were forced to pay in getting a new room. Actually they blamed us because we didn’t “follow their policy” and said “if you only followed the policy we could help you more.” Thanks for the victim blaming!  Thankfully we booked a very last minute hotel room that wasn’t at all a condo, or ocean front, was $1400 MORE and we were forced to cut our vacation an entire day short. So in a sense, nothing like we wanted or had paid for but it was better than sleeping in our car with our children. We will never EVER EVER book through Airbnb ever again and it was completely, 100%  evident that this “host” literally doesn’t care about the comfort or safety of their guests and their children. Seriously, just book through a hotel site and safe yourself mental anguish."

I've reposted it multiple times on Google Play Store (with the number of times included). Here's the review: I'm a first time user of this service. This was an expensive and terrible choice. I was charged hundreds of dollars for a dirty room on filthy, unkept premises. I only stayed in the room one night because I came in late. I opened a case the next day and followed all the necessary steps i was given. After all of that, Air BNB and their ""superhost"" decided that no policy was violated on their end (even though i provided ample proof) and they stole my money."

Besides, the ACs were not centralized and none in the living room. The 2 ACs in the 2 bedrooms were too small power to cover the areas so we sweat throughout the night. We wrote such feedback but responded by bnb they would not post our feedback due to some criteria/agreement in their policy. We asked what criteria/agreement and they just sent us a link to read. So I believe people won’t see full accountable reviews from bnb. Only the good portions are emphasized to attract more customers."

(Whaaat?) I didn’t feel safe and canceled the reservation 5 minutes after he sent me the link to upload all that info. The host and Airbnb charged me 300 usd for an apartment I never stayed (they can't give me the full refund, just 50%. That's their ""grace period"" ) Airbnb Customer support wasn't helpful at all. Instead of taking a look into this host that is asking people to upload private information and make payments on unsafe third party platforms, they just blamed me for not reading the house rules. I asked them for a link to write a review on the host... Never heard back from Airbnb. I asked them for a full refund since I cancelled 5 minutes right after I booked it, never heard back from Airbnb. The supervisor was going to call me to solve this issue, never heard back from her. She sent me a message today saying ""the host was very firm and we couldn't ask him to give you the full refund"". Airbnb only protects host, they don't care about the guests at all. Airbnb is not trustworthy at all, support scams, doesn't take ownership when things get messy, and just charges customers unreasonable fees. I'm switching to other BETTER platforms, where people don't abandon you when something bad happens."

507,Luca,GB,1 review,"Monday, September 13, 2021, 10:51:51 AM",1,Insight into Airbnb's internal processes with regards to claims by a host on a guest,"I stayed in a property on August 14th, I was left a good review by my host and thought nothing else of it. Three weeks later, on the 9th of September, I receive a claim for a mirror for £92.99, which apparently was discovered missing in the property on the 20th of August. Allegedly, nobody else had stayed in the property since my stay. The proof was a photo of the mirror on the wall, then a photo with it missing... Needless to say, neither me nor my party removed the mirror. You'll just have to trust me here. However, I received an email from Airbnb's resolutions team as follows:'Violation Categorization: Property Damage+ H filed a claim for damaged mirrorContext Assessment: No Aggravating/Mitigating factors+ G denied the claim in RC comments+ no clear scenario on how the item was damagedBurden of Proof: Allegation Alone+ not enough context to confirm G caused the damagesSummary Action:+ Note G's account - 1st report: Note that claim was made - any future cases default to “facts suggest guest at fault”'It was pretty clear to me that this was not meant to be sent to me. It looked like Airbnb's internal notes. This was confirmed by the following email:'My sincerest apologies for my previous email, kindly disregard it.I'm XXX (name omitted) from the Airbnb Claims team. I am contacting you, because your host TIFA Stays notified us of damage following your reservation HM8QKS4NC2 and has asked that Airbnb mediate this case. You can view the Resolution Center request at:..After careful review of all photos, documentation, and related communication provided by both parties, we’ve decided not to charge you for the damage caused during your stay.To prevent further action on your account in the future, please review the Security section of the Airbnb Community Standards. You can read those standards...' This is all well and good, but I was made to feel in subsequent emails that I should be grateful I wasn't charged, when there is zero evidence that I did this (indeed I did not!). Instead, it feels very dodgy that they claimed to find out about it on the 20th of August but did not claim until the 9th of September. Who would discover that then and not claim on it for three weeks?Regardless, the element of most alarm to me, the reason why I won't use Airbnb again, is the wording of the internal note. My reading of the final part, 'Note that claim was made - any future cases default to “facts suggest guest at fault”' says to me that, if a future host claimed £500 for wrecking their whole house, with little or poor evidence, Airbnb would default to believing the host regardless of what the evidence suggests. If this is standard Airbnb policy, I would prefer to pay extra to stay elsewhere, in case I open myself up to future fraudulent / unfair claims by hosts, where I will have no opportunity to fair debate with the resolutions team at Airbnb. Hopefully others will be now aware of how they handle this as it is probably their normal practice to do so, based on the awful reviews I am now reading from others about this company (hosts and guests!!)."

I contacted Airbnb for a refund, as I didn’t agree to the mask rule. I was told pretty much that it didn’t matter that he sent me the info after the refund period, they would not refund me. The property has a right to have whatever rules they want, but they should be fully disclosed within the refund period in case the renter does not agree to those rental terms. I have opened a BBB claim. I canceled my future rentals I had booked for the yr. we are a family who travels multiple times a yr. they’ve cost themselves way more in future rentals with us, than they would’ve lost by refunding me. You know a company is crooked when they get so big that they can have over 5,000 complaints on BBB and it doesn’t affect their overall grade, so they don’t care.

Went to a trip to Portugal, Faro, host name is Joao and he has 96 listings with Airbnb.  The place had nothing to do with what was advertised on the pictures and, what was worse, it was very, very noisy all day and night.  I did not complain immediately, only on day 2.  I was promised that they would do something if the noise continues on the next night, and they did nothing when I complained again.  I tried to sort it myself but was ignored by the noise makers whom I believe were the building owners.  I moved out to a hotel.  They rejected my request to amend my reservation and charged me the full amount of my stay (8 days instead of the 3 I was in).  Airbnb support was ridiculous, completely useless, annoying even - they kept making up reasons why they cannot refund me and kept repeating that they were sorry.The host wrote a review about me which was a lie.  They also commented on my review with lies, including claiming that I was threatening them on personal messages.  Requested that Airbnb delete these and again - they informed me that they will not because there is no breach of their policies.  And again robotic apologies and BS.  Now the good thing about EU is there are mandatory mediation schemes that all businesses have to use.  So let's see what happens there, because apparently Airbnb support consists of robots and in order to get to a human you really must escalate.  Especially if the host you stand against is a lying, arrogant, greedy creep with 96 listings on the platform."

There are expensive cleaning fees and service fees on top of taxes. I ended up paying $260 per night when the house was advertised for $150 per night due to all of the hidden fees. Make sure you inquire about all expenses before booking…especially if it is non refundable.

I am exhausted by the poor service at Air BNB. They do not care about the customer - BEWARE. I have had multiple bad experiences and I will not use them again.  The first time I used them the lady left the key inside the door in South Carolina.  Asked me to come in the front door and get a key to my room.  No address was visible at 9 PM.  I could have been shot.  I entered my room, someone else sleeping in my room, the bigger of the two guest rooms. During COVID I canceled on March 2019 avoiding a convention, only offered refunds a few days later.  So many who attended the conference got COVID - early COVID. I sent a request for a refund, sorry not in the date range.  It paid for me to be smart, but not to use Air BNB. Multiple times I have booked rooms at vacation spots, multiple times they have accepted, then canceled stating the listing was incorrect and it was to be twice as much.  I stated I had a contract, too bad, no support, once weeks away from a big outdoor event.  They do not care about customers only the property owners. I recently booked a condo at a good rate in the spring in Florida.  it was accepted.  I tried to add a day immediately following.  The lady sent an email stating the rate was incorrect, new room, was not supposed to be listed.  I canceled it. I booked another, less desirable condo.  Then the lady from the first one said her mistake, if I accept double the rate, it's mine.  I accepted it as the rate was fair, and I canceled the other.  All in less than an hour. Air BNB charged me a $250 booking fee - my cancellation does not qualify.  They have costs they say.  I said some do Marriot and they do not charge me when I change.  I travel 150 nights a year, so I make changes as sometimes business meetings change - often.  They want business guys but only allow three changes a year.  I have had a number of changes in the last year due to COVID.  Second rate, money grabbers who care nothing about clients.  NEVER AGAIN FROM ME."

No matter how good a service is, for me, it’s how the business performs when something goes wrong that really proves their value to me - and not just because they charge service fees apparently for this reason! Tried to contact technical support as my account was locked.  First problem was even getting to contact them if you don’t have an account you can access as only option is in app support. Had to create a new account just to contact them.  Should be simple fix for most companies but if you are out, you are out which I found out from 4 phone calls and 3 days later. So no access to any of your bookings or no ability to confirm new bookings. Left me and my family in a right hole. Then when my new account got locked as I’d tried to input my number too many times, I was locked out again for 24 hours and response was to create another account…!  So very frustrated right now. Can’t be good business practise to have such poor customer support."

We rented Little Oak Love back in April 2021 for 2 weeks. We had friends & family flying in to celebrate with us. @airbnb and the host @littleoaklove would not refund us our money in it’s entirety for a 2 week rental in her condo. When we reached out to the host @littleoaklove regarding our health issues and concerns this was her response, “Traveling during a pandemic is definitely a risk”, but that she WOULD NOT refund us our money. When we booked in April things were getting better, but with the Delta virus things are spiraling especially in Charleston. Both the Airline and car rental refunded us our money with no problem. We had friends renting in the same complex cancel their reservations the same same day; their host completely understood and they were given a 100% refund. These are extenuating circumstances. @littleoaklove lack of compassion is mind boggling! This is an example of greed over compassion. BTW - We we were unable to leave this host a review on @airbnb"

These suggested that the property was near the beach, restaurants and a market. When we were given the address shortly before arriving it turned out to be a 15min drive away from the beach in a remote location.  We therefore had to spend money hiring a car. The reviews attached to the property are infact for a different property. I am shocked that air b and b have allowed reviews for another property to be linked to an entirely different one as I image most people use the reviews as a large part of their decision making process. The air bandb resolution centre advised they would look into it but I have had no feedback and am not confident they will do anything."

After the apartment was still being cleaned 1.5+ hours after check in time, beds that were listed were not even there, washing still hanging out to dry on the balcony, I asked airbnb for help as the host just threatened to cancel the stay whilst we were in the apartment. Airbnb customer service did absolutely nothing and in the end have deactivated MY account due to the host saying we had a ‘party’ as reasoning for her ridiculous cancellation time (she ended up cancelling after we had travelled 2+ hrs and we’re already in the apartment just because she didn’t want to reimburse us for the experience she lied about). The host was threatening to cancel the booking straight away because we brought up these issues with her apartment and once she cancelled, she verbally told us she’d be calling the police and texted me this threat too. She tried to make up that you can only book on Airbnb if you are 25+ and was trying to tell me it’s my fault and I shouldn’t even be in the building even though she had approved my ID prior to me booking. My 5 friends and I were left stranded on the sidewalk with reservations to places in the next few hours and Airbnb couldn’t of cared less. Not to mention, they ‘investigated’ the party we were supposedly having so I emailed over pictures of the hot tub still being drained, the cleaner that was stood in the apartment with us and the sofa bed that hasn’t even been made up. I still got penalised and the host gets no punishment for her awful service and ruining what could of been a great break away. THE WORST COMPANY AND SERVICE. I will forever tell friends and family to book elsewhere and save themselves the hassle and stress."

Airbnb is a complete ripoff and allows illegal practices from their host. I recently relocated to Atlanta, reserved a long term stay only to be told by the building management that the host was being evicted due to an unpaid balance of over $12,000 AND that Airbnb’s were not allowed to be in their building because it’s a violation of the lease. I advised Airbnb of this issue and that I now will be homeless with my daughter in a state that I have absolutely no where else to go. The rep told me that she would adjust my check out date to reflect the eviction date and remove the remainder of the balance since I am being forced to vacate the property. A few days later I get an alert from my credit card for an attempt to withdraw over $2,000 from Airbnb. I inquired about it and I was told that I had an unpaid balance from my stay with my prior Airbnb host. Um hello how in the heck do you justify this. I was forced to leave due to the host being evicted and you expect me to pay for a place that I am not even at due to someone else’s irresponsible behavior. Then I started to get collection calls. Now I’m in another Airbnb and my payment for this one was collected and forwarded to the prior host that was evicted. Now I have to leave because it looks like I haven’t paid for my current stay. Please be aware of Airbnb’s illegal, unjustified and unprofessional actions. Find somewhere to stay and please stay clear of this company. They will steal your money and have you stranded somewhere and could care less about it."

That's language meant to make you believe they're on the job, ready to do something for you, but the reality is you rely on pure luck.Under these circumstances you can't help but wonder why you would ever want to pay them any fees when you can try your luck directly with your host. It's simply pointless and a waste of time to have to deal with an additional entity if they reply after your 2-week vacation is over.At this point I can only give them the minimum rating of 1 star, considering our vacation was a mess and they were completely absent, but we'll see if anything changes for the better with our open support case. One can only hope.Maybe we were lucky before (2 other times) when we booked other reservations through them and it all went well at our destination, but this time it didn't go well and just when we needed Airbnb, they were nowhere - for 2 weeks."

Delete account.We have booked a room in Sesimbra, from August 14th to 15th. When trying to communicate with the host to check in, we got no response for 3 hours. When he answered, the guy, offered us a full refund and invited us for coffee the next morning... What a surprise when we were woken up by the screaming guy at 8 am saying we had to leave the house because we were going to get reimbursed. We did this to avoid conflicts with people clearly under the influence of alcohol (and other drugs).Of course, this individual didn't refund us, and stopped responding to messages. He´s even threathning us through messenger now. When contacting Portuguese Airbnb support to ask for a refund, we´ve found a slow and unhelpful customer service who simply said that we couldn't be refunded because the house had damage, (without any pictures to prove) which is clearly a lie.After saying that the issue wasn´t solved, I was forwarded to global customer support who blocked my account, while ""analyzing the case"" and asking questions without any connection to the threat or to the refund.Yes, the host threatened us through the messenger, but airbnb ignores the printscreens with proofs and that this was a dangerous situation to us.Despite being kicked out of the house and threatened by host Mana Kai Paddle, they are still threatening me above, with a reprimand: ""If we receive a similar report in the future we may have to take additional action on your account.""Their replies were limited to running away from my questions and sending house rules, while the rights of guests who are expelled and threatened, are not a reference whatsoever.The cherry on the top of the cake? On airbnb messenger, they ask if the case is solved, but they block the options, yes and no. Delete your airbnb account ASAP."

Airbnb's policies not only facilitate this but they actively work to compound the damage.  The guest has nothing to lose and the host's livelihood is on the line.Over the last 2 years, I've earned 14 consecutive 5* reviews, have a mean score of 5.0, Superhost status and reliably appeared high up in searches for a one-bedroom apartment in my city.  My last guest, who had no previous reviews, chose to punish me for not giving her the refund she wanted on her non-refundable stay. She gave me a 1* rating and wrote just four words (""not worth your consideration""). This punitive review & rating doesn't contravene any Airbnb policy and Airbnb support have refused to take it down. As a model Airbnb host:- I consistently provide a first-rate service that has earned me fourteen consecutive 5* ratings on my apartment (average rating of 5.0)- I have earned and retained Airbnb Superhost status- I accept long stay bookings with Airbnb’s default long term cancellation policy- I accept Instant Bookings from guests without a previous recommendation - I offered my guest a refund on the non-refundable stay but she declined as she considered the amount insufficient (she would lose the benefit of my long stay discount) It’s at this point that hosts need Airbnb to step in and do the right thing. Instead, Airbnb is busy compounding and amplifying the punishment. Specifically:- Airbnb has sent me a delinquency notification advising that my listing is at risk of being suspended. - Airbnb will remove my Superhost status at the next evaluation. It will be mathematically impossible for me to regain my Superhost status for at least 12 months after her review- Airbnb will incorporate the 1* rating in its algorithm that determines search order which will negatively impact my listing and business- Airbnb will incorporate the 1* rating in my average score and I will never be able to regain my 5.0 average. Punished imperpetuum.- Airbnb no longer publishes the ratings next to a review. This means that prospective future guests can only see my mean score and are unable to distinguish between a single aberrant review and an overall mediocre listing. Other online platforms provide much more transparency so that users can see the mean, mode and median ratings. Amazon is a good example of how informative reviews can be. Airbnb’s lack of transparency serves to increase the damage to hosts of a punitive rating. Airbnb encourages hosts to accommodate long-term stays that are non-refundable  and then allow guests to punish hosts when we stand by the policy. Airbnb’s review system facilitates a punitive review/rating and provides no support whatsoever to hosts who are victims of such punishment. Airbnb then uses a range of tools and policies to maximise the impact of the punishment. The impact on me, my listing and my business is incalculable. I’ve taken my Airbnb listing off-line and looking to start from scratch; two years of hard work down the drain. If Airbnb truly values the host community then urgent action is needed to rectify the damage done. Not just in this specific case but by introducing policies that appropriately protect hosts from vindictive guests."

The apartment was dirty and a lot of things were missing. I reported these concerns and problems to the owner, but he would not do anything despite my many reminders. In short, I wanted to post my review and tell my misadventure, but my review was removed by Airbnb for a spurious reason. This is my last experience with Airbnb. I will now make sure to advise against it to all my friends, family members and contacts.It is better to prefer a local real estate agency as I have been doing for a long time.

Whilst staying there I noticed a terrible smell. Which on inspecting turned out to be a cupboard full of paint and white spirt directly off the living area.It was unlocked and I had a child staying with me. I contacted Airbnb on my return - to tell them and ensure it was fixed for future guests (I had contacted the owner but they didn't do anything about it).Airbnb closed the case without even replying to me. Whilst I realise it was out of their 24hr 'refund' window - I wasn't trying to get a refund. I was trying to stop a potentially dangerous situation for future guests.I'm pretty sure storing this kind of material next to a sleeping area is probably not legal. I took photos and offered to show them - but frankly they don't seem to care now they have my money.Pretty shocking.

I have all proof  that guest and me and airbnb were communicating even since the first min of this damage happened. But still, the case manager just avoided all my proof and insisted that I didn't submit the claim within the time frame, I wondering if he/she really read my email well . ( July. 14, the damage happened, the guest informed me. July. 16, the guest checked out, we called Airbnb about this damage, and kept communication with Airbnb in between until July.18, since we both couldn't come out with the agreement for the payment of the damage,  so I submitted the case in Airbnb on July.18.Since then, Until Aug.4, nobody from Airbnb contact me again, instead, they closed my case without informing me. So I called again, but never got any feedback. Aug.8, I called Airbnb again, the customer service Hans on phone also admitted that I followed up all steps correct, and also confirmed me that I did submit the claim within the time frame so he reopened the case for me. Aug.11, I messaged Hans to follow up, no reply. Aug.17, I messaged Hans to follow up, no reply. Aug.20, I messaged Airbnb Support Diego about this, no follow up. Sep.1. Airbnb case manager Briana emailed me. And told me that I didn't submit my case within the time frame, she even didn't read my proof well. )This is not just first case happened like this, it is more than 3 times. And there is also a lot of different horrible stories happened between me and the airbnb. Again, if you want to list your properties, go to other marketplace, avoid Airbnb. They said they will protect the host and guest fairly, but trust me, once you need to claim from them if the guest refuse to pay, then you will know what I meant. And since I am on my way to move all my lists from Airbnb to VRBO and my own website, I still need to work with them right now. Just can't wait to leave this website forever!!!! And, they even charge such high service fee but just did not do their job. And I am Rita, I host in Rochester, MN. Welcome to find me there in case someone think this is fake review."

This time I have chosen to blow the whistle and inform AirBnb Hosts of my experiences.This is what they advertise: “If a guest damages your place or belongings during a stay and doesn't reimburse you, you may be protected with up to $1,000,000 USD property damage protection”A guest had an unauthorized party in my Luxury Villa on the Atlantic Seaboard. My beautiful home, destroyed and damaged beyond words. After being sent from pillar to post and collecting a myriad of invoices and quotations from professional service providers to support my $8,490 claim, I was offered a lousy $1,391.25Not many explanations were provided by Airbnb as to how they arrived at this amount. Their claim agents use some templates to answer my direct questions.Had I known this would be the case, I would have taken out my own BnB Insurance Policy.So much for hard work and being a SuperHost."

We booked for a month and stayed one night, on arrival immediately contacted hosts. About the issues, they were more concerned with how us leaving would put them in a bad spot than there deception putting us in a spot.House was not as described at all.Turned up the lawn and gardens we’re extremely overgrown mail was overflowing from the mail box  the back area was a mess.Inside the fridge had previous guests food in it  the house was not clean, windows have never been cleaned to the point of not being able to see out, we are in a pandemic where cleanliness should be a TOP priority. The kitchen had unfinished butcher block tops which had imbedded black mold in them and were all curled up. Appliances were unclean.There was blood on the bed sheets.The windows could not be opened as we tried to remove the stale smell.There was a power outlet right next to the shower which I am sure is a safety hazard.We went through the process of asking for a refund per the Airbnb policy, as stated we were to try to sort out resolution with the owners which we did and we received a partial refund with the owners with holding 3 nights minimum at a higher rate than what our rate was and the kicker a cleaning fee the house was not cleaned when we walked in so they charge us a fee to clean. Not happy with this we went to Airbnb. Our resolution manager was totally useless. He basically did the same process we did and asked the owners to pay more they said no. 2 days into the supposed investigation he goes on vacation for a couple of days then we had to contact him to get an answer on his return he basically did nothing.Guest beware the Airbnb site states that you need to try to resolve the dispute with the host first what they don’t tell you is to get a full refund you need to notify Airbnb within 24hrs of check in that the property did not meet standard.(even though all conversations where had through there site it does not count)The issue is when you contact your host and ask for a refund  which can only be done after you cancel the reservation, the hosts have 72 hrs to respond. Our hosts obviously knew that if they stalled with an answer for more that 24hrs which they did that Airbnb would not force a full refund. This resulted in this horrible experience allowing the owners and Airbnb stealing  $1000 dollars for the worst nights accommodation experience we have ever had.This property should be removed from the list but as it seems Airbnb do not vet the properties they are probably many more like this one out there.Topper is by the time Air BnB FINALLY replied to us we are not outside the window to leave a review...AMAZING!"

We had the worst time at the cottage. Power cuts due to faulty extension leads apparently but if pne tv was on and you tried another electrical appliances all fuses blew and were left for two hours a time with no power. The Hot tub worked one night and after the first power cut wouldnt warm up and the host Tony wsas rude and arrogant and made me feel I was being a pain. The slab leading out into the pebble garden was all broken to pieces and my disbaled son fell over after tripping on it. The hosts live next dor and the second night had guests over and had music playing until 2am! the cottage was full of cobwebs and spiders especially in bedrooms and my daughter was bitten byu a spider. there are cracks in bedroom windows covered in duck tape. The location was the only good thing so we could get out but i woulkd not recommend anyone to ever stay here !!!

Or bother about taking your own “resolution center” too seriously. In the case on hand the “resolution centre”’s resolution was to close the case. The host had not responded to their certainly very kind refund reminder. “Sorry, nothing we can do. Case closed.” I felt reminded of when the London MET police informed me within an hour of me reporting that my stolen-bicycle-case had been close. Only the police have the excuse that they have got other things to do too.  While the MET advised me to go look for my stolen bike on second-hand exchange websites, Airbnb told me to continue to chase the hosts myself. All in all, I have to exclaim my disappointment with Airbnb service and customer care in particular."

I contacted the resolution centre at AIRBNB to be told I had to contact them within 2 days of check in. I explained I attempted to give the host the opportunity to fix things first and messaged the via the app and so felt there refusal to get involved was unhelpful at best and they just washed their hands of the complaint. This was my second bad experience after recently having a property cancel my booking the day before arrival. I was offered £17 compensation which had to be used with 30 days. I will not use them again. The traditional booking sites are just as cheap and more reliable.

When you make a claim, it mysteriously dissappears a few days later. You are advised to make a new one which dissappears, and again. After a few tries, you get blocked out on the last step preventing the finish step. If you actually make it to someone in Resolutions, look for an odd encrypted email because they ditch their thread and use this easy to miss method. I had mild wall damage, sheet damage and missing towels. I was actually asked by resolutions to do a police report. The police officer thought this was some sort of prank.Towel theaft at a hotel like lodging is my criminal report? When I responded to the Airbnb resolution's emails promptly, she decided we needed to speak by phone, at 2am! Yes 2am, which apparently is 9am in India.The agent had my numbers completely wrong and said since my claim is over $1000 we need a police report. I told her my claim is less than that. In the same conversation she changed the police report requirement to my claim amount. Wait what? When I brought up this discrepancy she hung up the phone. It all was over a month and countless hours. The claim is denied because she simply isn't happy with how the police did their report. The report was made in the same country and state Airbnb started in. I went into this making my units cute and fun. Now it's Walmart's cheapest and thrift stores next, raise rates to cover potential thieves, and do whatever it takes to avoid Resolution department. Crying shame."

I have been a host through Airbnb for several years, most of that time as a Superhost with a 4.8 rating over 192 reviews. My experience with Airbnb customer service and resolution over the years has been routinely awful and each time I have wondered afterward why I bothered contacting them. They give bad or wrong advice and always make the complaint process way too difficult. Recently a guest stayed for a week of a longer term stay and decided to leave early. I was okay with that and contacted Airbnb to issue a full refund for the remainder of the stay, which they did. But then the guest demanded a full refund for the week they stayed and promised to not leave negative feedback if I wired them $800. This constituted Feedback Manipulation under Airbnb's rules. See email proof: "" As mentioned, I won't post any review on Airbnb which should allow you to keep your rating on there. Please e-transfer $800 to my email address rayyip***com at your early convenience. Thank you.Ray"" When I refused to bow to this blackmail the guest posted a terrible negative review full of exaggerations. I contacted Airbnb with a copy of the email and heard nothing for a week. I contacted them again to try to get the review removed and luckily got one of the few reasonable customer support people. She referred my complaint to another department and they (Jason) kept asking for a screenshot of the message even though I had copied it to them. After more than two weeks from my first contact and with apologies for the delays in response due to a ""backlog of cases"", they decided that I had not sent sufficient proof because I had not sent a screenshot of the message thread that they have on their own system within two days. Griffith V wrote ""Hi Roger. We will now go ahead and close this case that we're dealing with. Please know that we are always here to help out."" It seems that they are only interested in getting rid of cases as quickly as possible by making the complaint process onerous and not worth the time and effort. In this they are truly successful. As helpful customer service people they are truly awful and useless. I have cancelled my account."

He didn't, he was waiting for the 24 hours delay to pass, so he would get the money. Nevertheless, I raised a complain in due time, to the host and Airbnb. The host clearly lied to me. Airbnb opened a file, reimbursed most of the money, but kept >600 Eur and refused to reimburse me the 1st night at the hotel, because I decided I couldn't stay there with my mom.

One day later receive call from them - they asked about providing facts. Sent pictures. Explain concern. The told they will help with the issues. Same day receive many calls from Airbnb, they said we will review you case and send information to clams manager overall talking time about 2 hours. Next day the room was changed to bigger but still not matching with booking. Talk  this to Airbnb- they recorded and promise to help with refund and booking new place - they newer did. During stay the call me and talk about bug just wasting time.  The room has a cockroaches, spiders, loud neighbors, loud air conditioner, lizards. Send update to the Airbnb- they said we help you but nothing. Finally 3 days before leaving (overall stay 15 days) the owner contacted me and ask why I decide to cancel three day before- I explained about issue and what I had issues from day one but she regretted all explanation and said all is right. Later I had a message from Airbnb which tell we are protect ours hosted and do not refund you anything. Game over!

The host advised that the unit was cleaned that morning and we can check-in at anytime. Great. When we checked in we were immediately greeted with the most unbearable smell of garbage in the unit. It literally smelled like an open bag of warm trash on a hot day. I immediately contacted the host and left the unit. After several hours of not hearing from him, I decided to cancel the stay and find a hotel for the weekend. 3 days of messaging back and fourth with the host and airbnb's customer service team, it was decided that I was not eligible for a refund because I did not document (they wanted a picture of the smell) the situation at the unit, and I did not give the host a chance to correct the issue. 1. I have messages confirming the unit was cleaned prior to my arrival. Why does the unit smell like actual garbage?2. The host did not reach back out to me for hours. Just long enough for me to decide to spend more money on another place near Boston. Why was the host not available for that long after I had just checked into the unit?3. How do you take a picture of a smell?Airbnb is a terrible app that uses its policy to protect hosts that don't properly clean their apartments. In this day and age of covid and now a delta variant it is completely unacceptable for airbnb to charge people good money for smelly & unsanitized spaces and using their policy to protect their hosts.I will rent a stay at the morgue before I rent with Airbnb again."

I canceled, then I received a message stating I received a $0 refund. I contacted support and they said it's within 48 hours, but because I purchased a stay longer than 30+ days, its nonrefundable. Very misleading, they left that detail out on their phone application. I'm now down $400. I have no other money to create a new reservation. Thanks a lot."

I arrived with purse on Aug 19, switched my purse out to a MCM purse to match my outfit, I clearly took my blue Gucci $1500 purse and put it in my dust bag and sat it in closet.

598,jason lawrenson,NL,5 reviews,"Tuesday, August 24, 2021, 07:28:23 AM",1,Airbnb will literally rent anything for money,"I recently booked a unique stay from Airbnb's web site. It was supposed to be a unique stay, a house boot in Naarden The Netherlands. After finding a number of issues which were reported it was made apparent by the guy fixing the problems that it was busy because what I had booked was part of 300+ accommodations in The Netherlands. my unique stay was part of the marinaparcs.com setup. This kind of answers the reason why it took literally weeks to answer any questions I asked on the message service on Airbnb. The so called owners Huub & Sylvia are simply working on filing rooms for Marina Parc. This also explains the lack of cleaning and upkeep on the unit. After making a complaint to Airbnb they said no refund would given because the other complaints I had were later than 24 hours of arrival which I thought was harsh because the other complains were not made apparent until 2 days later. Airbnb also said that ""our host can lease any property under their name as long as the listing is under their account. The listing is not limited to guest owning the property so long as the host doesn't have any issues with the landlord"". So there you have it folks, make sure you go though your property with a fine tooth comb and within 24 hours and be happy that your not so unique stay is making the larger companies richer because they are no rich enough.No refund was offered - No apology was offered."

End of May NSW went into lockdown. I contacted my host April regarding this and she was happy to reschedule for September school holiday, which I thought would be fine as the alternative was only getting back 50%. However we have now been advised lockdown will continue for NSW until end of September, lockdown has been continuously extended for us. Canberra also went into lockdown a couple of weeks ago and I was surprised that my host April didn’t cancel my accommodation as both states are now in lockdown. I spoke to April  about a full refund as legally speaking ACT and NSW have stay at home orders and are in lockdown, and I can not enter ACT or use this accomodation. To this my host responded I will only get back 50% of the full amount I have paid for my accommodation, and that she can give me credit that will last 1 year but she has NO available dates after November 2021 for this accomodation right now. Which made zero sense to me, why would I take credit when the host can’t even give me a date that the accomodation will be available again next year. I refused and went back and forth between air bnb and April. Air bnb was of no help, they kept quoting that it is up to the host and this does not count as excruciating circumstances and does not qualify for a full refund and that I would have to work something out with the host. My greedy host April advised its her decision and that air bnb can’t go over her decision. She kept saying no to a full refund and kept advising this is “the best she can do”, and that “covid has impacted small businesses for her too”. Which is funny for someone who has 13 PROPERTIES listed on air bnb. The rich get richer. At each time I gave 1 month notice and this still wasn’t good enough. Air bnb kept their service fee of $100 and refused to refund this to me, and the host kept 50% of my accommodation. I will never again book with air bnb. I’m so disgusted with how I was treated, I even asked air bnb to lodge a formal complaint and all I kept getting was “the only option is to lodge a feedback.” What a joke, considering the feedback form section advises that it may or may not be looked into as it’s only FEEDBACK."

They locked my account because of a guest complaint that was later found to be unfounded and posted by a fake profile who severely damaged my property. During that time, I was required to honor all the previously booked stays but couldn't accept new ones. So, I wasn't even able to rent out my apartment in any other way. Recently, i got an instant booking - even though I have had my account on snooze since March of 2020 (1.5 years ago) - and was charged $100 for canceling within 1 hour of receiving the booking. When you go to turn off the auto booking feature, it says ""you can cancel penalty free""... hmmm... that doesn't sound completely true now, does it."

I had to switch to long term rental as I have run out of days for short term let in London. When you do it on the app it asks to remove the limit and than asks to set monthly price. In a few hours I got a 3 month reservation but it was calculated on a nightly price (which I didn’t set, as I always set prices at the time I open dates - so it used random base price I used long time ago for smart pricing. Also when you set monthly price it clearly states on the top it will overwrite any daily rates and discounts). I contacted their customer service as I could not find where this monthly prices are, I was told I could not see or amend them in the app (so I can set them in the app but can’t see them or change them in the app - billion dollars company!). The agent sent me screenshot to show those prices…which were set as they could see it. Explained they are used prorata 1st to 30th or whatever end of the month. So guests can only book full months, only strictly 1st to the end? I didn’t get an answer for that, it was ignored. I said fine…days falling out should be counted daily but what about full months in between which are taken beginning to the end - no answer? Reply I got that I never set the monthly price in the first place for that reservation. Although I did set as per the app requirements…did not have access to it after it was set and agent sent me screenshot confirming it. Absolutely low quality, just slightly better than chat bot customer service. No knowledge of their product, no responsibility, poor app, no supervision. What their management team is doing is a secret! They have submitted a review report which came out with the same information…so I actually see something in their chat but real people tell it’s not that case, I even start to doubt if it  is me who is an idiot as they are so convincing in their ignorance. But I know what their finance team does that’s for sure! I am in shock as I like Airbnb but clearly only until everything works. So poor!"

So this was my first and last time booking via Airbnb.Booked a house for approx 2.800 EUR in Spain for my birthday for a weekend many months ahead. I had invited guests, made travel arrangements and other arrangements in Spain for the weekend. A few hours before check-in, the host calls me and cancels due to a supposedly 'water damager' which they btw could not prove via pictures or otherwise. I then spent 5 hours on the phone with Airbnb during the night to try and get them to first of all talk to the host to get the official cancellation (which took them 2 hours) and then try to resolve and find us another accomodation which they never did. I could not get an answer to any of my questions, could not get any help or resolution.Due to the late cancellation I got stock with additional costs for arrangments of 3.000 I had paid in advance that I could not get reimbursed.So I ended up with no house and an additional cost of 3.000EUR, which Airbnb did never covered any of.The case is still ongoing and is shuffled between different customer agents still with no help or answer to any question.I will never use Airbnb again and cannot recommend it to anyone!"

She totally understand how the host manipulated the pin drop of his location but she choice to close the case. I objected to close the case based on the strong evidence that the host location was 500-700 far away with a high way splitting the two area.She was objecting to help me in getting a full refund from the host. When I ask her to explain why she said it doesn't matter where is the pin dropped but it is about the circle with a radius on a map. This is absurd because the host's real address was almost on the margin of the circle (500m distant). This was not enough for her to hold the host accountable. She said the the pin drops automatically by the system and the host cannot change it. However, this is not true because any host when listing his location can easily manipulate the pin. She at this point refuses to re-investigate or change her decision to close the support ticket or even to refer me to other agent because I quote ""of how this would perceive negatively by her superiors"" (who might advice her to just close the ticket) .I have provided all the evidence about the huge inequality between the two areas as 500 meter distant in a city centre can be two different areas and not to mentioned the high way that splits the two apart. The georgical features of each is very unique. The host's real address was in the bottom of the valley in a very difficult terrine and the city centre (Taksim, Istanbul) was in top of the hill. Also the real host area was not touristic and very danger even for the locals as it is known area for selling and buying drugs. This was not enough for the agent to re-investigate the case, refer me to another agent with willingness to investigate or hold the host accountable. Instead, she wants me to accept that she closes the case and be victim of the manipulative host. Hell, no. I booked for a month paying almost 700$ for this crappy location was not my ideal plan to spend my holiday in Istanbul.Luckily, I have confronted the host and demanded a full refund immediately which he to my surprise released instantly after calling out his manipulative behaviour of reallocating the pin somewhere else to attract renter so Airbnb can bully later on.In summary, airbnb must hold hosts accountable for these manipulative practices and sided with facts and evidence instead of what is easy like closing the dispute to look good in-front of superiors. My experience taught me to never the trust the airbnb's PIN.I hope Airbnb improve in how they treat those who rents and stop supporting those manipulative hosts. Taking sides with hosts against vulnerable clients like me who trusted you with our own funds is victimizing.Learn from Amazon and Ebay,Reservation detailsConfirmation codeHMDJQKZMYB"

My husband and I just experienced the most horrific and inhuman experience with Airbnb and one it’s host Marianne Harper. I agree with one of other reviews that the customer is never right. On 08/20/2021 Marianne Harper at Lakefront Wharf #1932 wrongfully evicted my husband and I because we complained that the air conditioner did not work. Even after setting the air to 65 degrees Fahrenheit it still felt as though it was 95 degrees in the unit! We called Marianne and she told me to play with the breaker box. She also was upset because I told her the elevators weren’t working properly and that we had to walk 19 flights of stairs to our unit. She said that the condos were privately owned and the elevators had nothing to do with her and the owners unit. There were two sets of balcony furniture one that looked to have been intentionally turned over to stage a vandalism setting and one that wasn’t. When I brought this to Marianne’s attention she told me that I could simply pick it up and that maybe the storm knocked it over. Marianne Harper Is probably one of the worst human beings I’d ever come into contact with. Even from previous reviews on Airbnb It’s not unlikely to see Marianne respond to many of her paying customers in passive aggressive, inconsiderate and condescending ways! When I brought this to Airbnb’s attention the sense of urgency and the lack of empathy was simply shocking! To be 300 miles away from home and wrongfully evicted with no immediate refund is just a very traumatic and helpless feeling!! I was told by Airbnb that basically there was nothing they could do because it was 12 am. They told me numerous of times that a case manager would reach out to me and I still haven’t heard from anyone. My husband and I paid $694 to be treated worse than an animal! We were forced to purchase another hotel and No one seem to care not Marianne and certainly not Airbnb. In fact Airbnb representative told me to provide proof that the air conditioning unit was not working. When asked how would I accomplish that she told me to get a thermometer which seemed completely absurd because we were being evicted by security and even police!! I told the representative that I don’t walk around with a thermometer in my pocket! I just feel so hopeless and helpless because there is literally no one that will advocate for you as a customer!! Airbnb protects the host even when they’re wrong and it’s so unjust! I will from now on book through a hotel because at least I know if something went wrong they will work to serve their customer!! I am truly disgusted and all I can really do at this point is ask God to advocate for me!A totally DISGUSTED CUSTOMER!"
622,Customer,US,2 reviews,"Saturday, August 21, 2021, 03:22:55 PM",1,Airbnb: the customer is never right,"Over the years of international studying and traveling, I’ve often used Airbnb. Of course hosts in every country will differ in communication style, lodging, hospitality, and overall experience. Sometimes this is welcomed as an alternative to the hotels. However the negative experiences I’ve had came from Airbnb’s own policies, technology,  and their lack of authority in host/guest disputes.The most recent experience with a booking was the last blow to an already strained relationship with this company. As a customer/ guest/ traveler, I accept my responsibilities to the host and the fluidity of situations. However when there is something the company can do in the view of blatant abuse of policies, this is moment where the company can gain or completely lose my trust. I booked a three day stay at a studio apartment in Budapest the morning of. It was called Funhouse Center and hosted by a Super Host named Thibault. Upon arrival, the host had sent a friend of a friend to meet me. And the apartment was in a sad state compared to the pictures they advertised. There must be something to the equivalent of being catfished by an Airbnb lodging. I hate when people complain about the tiniest details like a hair on the floor or a fly on the wall. That stuff happens but won’t ruin the whole experience. I don’t consider myself a high maintenance traveler but walking into an apartment with brown stains on the curtains, curtains hiding unkempt odds and ends like a storage space, and run down decor with visible repair attempts should not be using its super new photos and asking for top hotel prices (Ibis next door asks for $78/night). I wanted to cancel my booking and was prepared to face the 50% booking fees. However if a booking is $278 and the refund is $101, that doesn’t seem like 50% to me. The host was very responsive until the moment I was not willing to stay at “Funhouse Center.” How would you feel if you did not want to stay somewhere because they gave the impression of a high end booking but you find it to be a glorified storage facility? And they business guys are too busy counting their loss to give you a refund? $178 profit for tricking visitors is actually easier than running a proper Airbnb. Well done. Hello, Airbnb customer service. What do your agents think? They don’t. They are told to follow the policy. Well this wasn’t a different apartment but had they posted actual pictures of the actual conditions, I would have have given this place a hard pass. No thank you! $83/ night let me find a hotel. So if you are ok with this kind of customer service in response to business people who make money on a 50% refund policy, go ahead and book your vacation. I didn’t come all the way for this and I will not stay in this sad neglected room. In many ways, this is a metaphor for Airbnb as a company. Once a beaming bright company with potential. And now, left on auto pilot and has not pushed for improvement. It’s going to accommodate as well as a guest is desperate. I have great respect for Hungary and their people, and this will not mar my impression of that. But to run a business this way and not take any responsibility will not encourage tourists or much else."

I have tried to make a reservation this morning but can't get through the verification process. They were quick enough to take the money before I was forced into the verification process. Couldn't enter my date of birth. Couldn't find my address in the Dropbox. And as for taking a verification photo, that's the most complicated thing I have found. And now after hanging on the phone for 45 minutes I still don't seem to be able to get my money back"

People on the phones are utterly clueless and simply read a script and follow a process, zero intelligence. We moved into a property and caught covid from our host whilst handing over keys etc. He has been understanding and allowed us to extend so we can complete our quarantine. Airbnb who apparently have a covid policy had initially told us don’t worry we will make sure you can stay, you won’t be kicked out before your quarantine ends. The following day their position had completely reversed. We were told that there’s nothing they can do and we’d have to leave if the host decided to ignore our request, they couldn’t advise us at all, the person we spoke to had no idea what to do. She actually said they have no duty of care. It was so appalling to be a family of three all sick with covid and have to deal with these total clowns. Even though the host has now been in touch and is allowing us to stay Airbnb have still not called me or messages me back to see what is happening. I asked them repeatedly to lodge a formal complaint, there is no procedure got that apparently.As a consumer of their product you are utterly without rights or recourse when things go wrong which they often do.Just unbelievably poor and they do not care."

I'm definitely not alone) Here is my story:  Book a hotel in Miami with Airbnb. When I arrived at the hotel I quickly realize the host completely misrepresent his place. Rooms do not look as advertised, with run-down furniture, broken phone, and AC. Request a refund and cancellation and got $135 at of $1200 spend! Here comes an interesting part of my experience. Airbnb not only refuses to issue an acceptable refund they also lie to me over the phone that they will start an investigation only to send me a generic reply one day later telling me basically to take a hike. Awful experience!  Avoid Airbnb at all costs!"

The instant book tab doesn't work. Made a couple of bookings for the hosts to decline and hike their price up by over 1,000 euros. No complaints process even though I asked several times to make a formal complaint. Just excuses from Airbnb. Trying to book for summer 2022 and was told that hosts haven't set prices yet, even under instant book which is meant to be a set price, which when previous reservations were cancelled I was advised to use by Airbnb.  Given covid and so many people moving holidays this isn't a valid reason. When I complained Airbnb they told me to just use a superhost?! Airbnb need to tighten up the system and monitor their hosts on a regular basis, this has just turned into a platform for people to advertise properties, nothing appears to be regulated and there is no cover for travellers. I would rather use Booking.com who have set prices when you book. Airbnb has become misleading and unreliable. V disappointing as it used to be a fantastic way to book independent accommodation."

I wanted to visit some beaches, and she recommended me Playa Caracol, so I tried to make a reservation with Airbnb, but for some reason I couldn't, so she made the reservation and I paid it. When I arrived the first thing I noticed was the apt was not facing the sea as it was advertised, so I contacted the host. She told me I was on time to cancel. I contacted Airbnb Customer Service, and requested, a swap of my reservation for one facing the sea. I was told by Cust Serv., they had to transfer the call to someone that was in charge of that, and that I was to be contacted ""soon""Nobody contacted me, so I contacted Cust. Serv. again, this time through a chat, and I was told (after several transfers to different people), that my niece had to cancel the reservation herself. I was already on Playa Caracol, half and hour drive from Panama City! I contacted the host again and asked her to cancel the reservation herself, and very nicely, she told me that she couldn't because Airbnb would penalized her.In short, Airbnb lost its shine. It's not anymore what It used to be. I have been both a host and a customer, for more than 8 years, not anymore.Think twice about using Airbnb, you better off finding and reserving a place by yourself."

The first thing i noticed was when trying to extend my trip by one day, I called customer service, and while on the phone with the representative I was also on the portal she quoted me a $311.00 difference ,the portal quoted me $300.93 I asked her why the difference she stated she did no know, but choose the portal price. I then received an email from turnkey stating my offer was declined, and I could accept the new and right quote, $416.00 as they don't know why the portal was quoting wrong prices, I declined. When me and my guest arrived to the property for our stay there was a deadly smell that encompassed the front,side,and back of the home, in addition to horse flies and hybrid mosquitoes,I contacted turnkey and was told by the representative that someone would be out to the property by 6pm, no one showed up until the next day after 11am, he stated as he walked up where is it i can smell it, he stated he would have to go get help to remove the dead animal but would be back. He never returned, we were stuck in the house with the exception of going out for food ,and coffee, the flies and mosquitoes would get it whenever you opened the door, the smell got worse by the day, we were ready to leave, had it not been a 6 hour drive to return to my comfortable home. I don’t plan on doing business with turnkey, I will stick to the rental properties we have used and enjoyed in the past, this was the worst vacation to date!!!

At one point It was suggested that perhaps I had made a mistake and I should check my bank again!.. At another point the lady asked if I would like to still stay in the property!.. ( Ridiculous because it wasn't available for booking anymore because my daughter in law booked it for us when my application was turned down!).That was 6 days ago and I have still not received a refund.In conclusion Airbnb can be a great experience as long as everything goes smoothly with the booking process if like me you end up having to negotiate their customer service department expect unprofessional behaviour, rudeness and a whole lot of stress!As far as I'm concerned Airbnb has stolen money out of my bank account because they have refused to explain adequately why the money was removed, refused to take any responsibility for removing my money and failed to explain adequately when they intend to give it back!Bunch of Thieve's!!!!"

My mom immediately contacted AirBnb to explain the situation and they are keeping HALF of the money paid for a stay we are not even going to enjoy now? I mean these are unprecedented times and all because we don’t feel comfortable going to a busy, city during a pandemic, they’re going to keep our money? It’s so wrong. They won’t even give us a credit so we can go when it all calms down again! They just want to take over 1k from us which could be used on another AirBnb once we feel comfortable going! So upset and so ridiculous as we own a small business and had to fight through COVID to stay alive in business and now there cutting us short on 1k after booking and having to cancel all within a time day time period… it’s not like we canceled a week before the date!?

That was 3 weeks ago and absolutely nothing has been done to rectify the situation. I now call them everyday only to be told that they will escalate the case knowing full well that I will never hear from them again. I have now lost 3 weeks of hosting experiences because of their inability to get my account up and running again, and have obviously lost a substantial amount of earnings as a result.

We had a guest whom we think has a mental problem and she came and stayed with us only as a revenge against the agreed policy of no refund from the day of arrival. She stayed for a week terrorising us and airbnb refunded refunded 100% to her without informing us. When the next guest arrived and the payout was about to come they opened up this case by deducting all the money from the new payout. So no pay for suffering that guest for 1 week and we have to let such frauds (she came under another name and police had to involve in taking her out of the house and we got to know from police its a different person) in the house for free. Airbnb do not care for any policies and they only try to squeeze the money out as much as they can and only say lies. There are definitely better alternatives than airbnb and people should stay from such business who easily breach the policy to squeeze money out of the host.

As a host, from my end, I couldn’t see if he had a profile picture. I accepted him then, finding that he didn’t have a picture, asked him to post one. He ignored this. I went to Airbnb who declared it was my responsibility to insist on a picture. I’ve said this is a safeguarding issue. I’ve had guests turning up before now who have used someone else’s profile then damaged my property, left a cream doughnut in the bed and poured toilet cleaner or the stairs. Airbnb refused to help. In the end I cancelled the guest and penalties were imposed on me. To waive the penalties, I’ve had to provide paperwork to verify that I’ve an operation coming up but as no dates were shown, the dates have changed three times, they refused to accept. I was given a ‘cancellation’ review. I ticked the ‘profile picture only’ box which made no difference. Within hours a woman requested to book, again no picture. It’s impossible to see from the hosts’ end whether there is a picture or not. In the past I’ve had guests use unsafe practices with electrics and occupy the kitchen for eight hours at a time. There were issues about having heating on all day when it was warm outside. When they were messing about with electrics, Airbnb said I could not ask them to go. In the end I wrote to the son and he changed his stay dates. I asked the family to leave by 9:30 as I was going out. Airbnb said I had no right and they could choose to go when they wished. I wrote a review to warn others but this was deleted as the booking was made by their demanding and difficult son, so it was third party. I still use Airbnb but am looking to use a different means of letting."

However, when everything is good, they take money first and keep 20%+ in their pocket. It is the most high risk business if you work with this company as host.  As guest, I will not use this company either, because there is not customer service, no guarantee on the cleanness especially with convid-19 situation, this company doesn't inspect any of the properties, so you might end up a huge surprise at door.

Not only did the guests disrespect the neighbours and our property, they were allowed to reduce the rating after we posted our feedback. Airbnb support is unavailable. We tried messaging and calls, but couldn't get through.For the record:The guests turned up having spent a few days elsewhere. They complained about the heat and too many people around. It's the Med, the height of summer, and an island! We showed them the information pack in their language and the rules. Not only did they leave doors shutters open on the balcony, a security issue, the shutters were left open on a windy day, banging against the tables and chairs. Of course people around complained when they were still banging at 10pm at night. Luckily there was no damage apart from a few scratches.The refuse collection is before 8am and the calendar clearly highlighting the days of different collections, with images. Bags and separate bins provided. They left a bag of mixed plastics and used sanitary towels outside and unsecured. Our neighbours had to go around the car park and pick these up and dispose of them. Sorry, that this is unacceptable, especially with Covid. They put used cutlery back in the drawer. Luckily everything is washed again, but that's disgusting.  We had to clean up a bloody trail from the bedroom to bathroom. We have high cleaning standards and the guests were allowed to reduce the rating for cleanliness and rules. Rules that they chose to ignore and after a six hour Covid clean too. After they left, one set of holidaymakers and the neighbours came around. We've known the neighbours for 10 years, they are friends. We trust them and they check on the property, as we do for them. They are certainly not liars. They told us about their behaviour, picking up personal refuse, and even the sullen attitude towards them and their dog. I feel ashamed that family stayed, it could have impacted upon us in the locale. On Vrbo, we have five star reviews on all aspects of the stay, our cleaning rating is at the highest, and we have no issues with any other holidaymakers. We'll keep on advertising with them instead. Airbnb has now lost a customer. Avoid them. They don't care. They allow guests to write what they want, to reduce their rating in retaliation, even though it's lies."

This time around our booking in NY was not as advertised from the awful smell in the house to the pool which was not private (even though the host said it was) to the host’s belongings filling the house (we had no space for our stuff) to the host’s two cars which blocked our claimed “free parking on premise”. The worst part wasn’t taking a week off and finding that our claimed vacation was nonexistent, actually that was a blessing compared to the worst part; airbnb customer service. They may answer your calls fast but when you want a refund you are handled by a department which you CANNOT contact by phone, you can only contact them if they open an airbnb “support” chat box in the airbnb app but even in that case, expect no progress folks. They will handle your case till their shift ends and you’re no longer their priority but don’t worry, they’ll tell you that their shift has ended and that the case will be handed to another employee! The twist is that sometimes the other employee doesn’t exist. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve called over and over again this week just to go through the same “case processing” with multiple employees and to be told false information. I got told my case was put on urgent and handled by an employee to find out from another representative hours later that actually no one is handling my case, I was told from another agent that they wanted to take SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS from us because we left the residence right when we saw it was not as advertised even though we talked to airbnb & the host right after arriving and no one told us that we should stay until a resolution came to be. Actually, if we would’ve stayed, they’d probably use it against us too. The same agent also told me that it’s not the host’s fault the pool is not private, he can’t control his neighbors! Nonetheless, I didn’t budge and threatened a lawsuit & to talk to paypal and the bank (which are serious options as we paid almost $4000) and at the end we got our full refund after various representatives. NEVER handling with this company again, it was an awful awful experience. STAY AWAY."

Now it's a total joke. I've been calling them +10 times over the last three days to solve a problem with a current booking. They are friendly to me on the phone but they don't get back to me and don't deliver on the different solutions they have proposed. Furthermore several of my calls have been answered just to be immediately hung up. Good stuff!

The place I rented was in Armenia, Colombia, but it is awfully bad: No hot water, the gas ran out of the oven; loud music coming from next door, lots of noise; gun shots at night, terrible neighborhood. It was a nightmare. So, I decided to get the hell out of there. The tenant didn't want to reimburse me. When I contacted Airbnb it took them two weeks to respond to me. By then, I had already contacted my credit card company, which finally did do much either. All and all, it was a bad deal for me. The only winner was that tenant whose place is obviously not suitable for rental. Airbnb doesn't care about its customers. Once you made that payment, you're basically on your own, they will not assist you. I am done with Aribnb. When I travel, I would rather look for apartments that I can actually visualize before making any type of commitment and payment."

If necessary, contact your credit card provider and get them to refund you instead. (This is known as section 75). We have just discovered that credit expires 1 year after it was issued. Clearly travel has been very difficult this last 18 months, but AirBnB refuse to reinstate the credit. (To add insult, they claim to be very sympathetic, but still refuse to do anything). They also said they have no complaints process. You send in your feedback, but the form clearly states that individual answers to feedback cannot be given. A total scam company - best to avoid entirely."

When I got to the cancellation page it said I would get 0 refunded and they hosts still insisted I would get a full refund. I have spoken to 2/3 customer service people who have told me I basically will not get a refund if the host decides to refuse.

Cancelled well within that limitation and the crooks took £70 off me for their service fee!

Of course I was asleep when this all happened so didn’t see it until 8am this morning. Two hours before we were due to head over there. To add insult to injury they offered £8.42 to help soften the blow! Well I can tell you, they can stick that eight quid where the sun doesn’t shine because I’ve just had to fork out £183 more for a last minute booking for the same two nights. Airbnb I HATE YOU AND YOUR COMPANY!

The reason was misuse of the partner credit which is their reward to agents every 6 months. We were never explained the rules for the partner credits but me and a colleague were fired without notice or reprimand or even a second chance. What sucks is that both of my personal accounts are blocked too. So not only they fired me for something I never thought was wrong, but Airbnb wants to persecute me even further by blocking all access. Just because I was transparent and naive. But using Airbnb in disguise is not a problem. During this year in customer support, myself and my peers really tried helping customers and did more than we were asked. But now I understand the general frustration among users. Harsh decisions are made without a thought. Meantime, all kinds of crooks and manipulative users and hosts exploit the system and defraud honest users. I don’t believe Airbnb will grow much further with such policies. Even during this year, I saw changes that made little sense but made our work in support more difficult. At the same time, ticket queues for some languages recently went over 10,000 tickets which means that users are not helped in 3-4 weeks after contact. I no longer blame people exploiting Airbnb. Another great business model disrupted by ugly changes and neglect of users."

I have a camera in my living room for mine and the guest safety and camera I have is listed on my arbnb profile couple of weeks later guest stared complaing about camera I gave him the option to turn it off when using the living room areas and turn it back on when leaving.   So long story short the guest acting aggressive day to day stared scaring me I am a black women living by myself so I kept the camra on and guest stared blocking the camera readjusting it and for documenting purposes I would inbox the issue to the guest on arbnb and guest argued with me about everything my rules and and washing his dishes,  I would end up washing it because it just sits in the sink for days  and asked arbnb I do not feel safe and to remove him, they did not do anything for a week and for that week I was sleeping over at a friends house because I was scared the way he was acting he might hurt me.  So I told arbnb I will have him removed if you will not, they said go head so I request guest to move out with in 2 to 4 day.  Then he moved out and after a week arbnb removed and blocked my account because of a camera reported in my living room.   I felt discrimination because the guest was white they came up with unrealistic reasons, thier own rule says I can have security camera as log as it not in the guest private room, or bathroom.   I trying to give them a chance to fix their decisions but they said that is their final decision.  I was disappointed to do business with such company like as arbnb they do not follow their own rules and regulations."

In addition, they lied about their listing and they lied about the internet which they did not have. I tried speaking to them over the phone and they said this is their private property and they charge the deposit outside of Air BnB. For the internet, it is broken. They misrepresented their listing, nothing including kitchen items (microwave, etc) was provided. Both the people including a 3 year old whom I made the reservation for were pretty troubled and scared. They threatened her and were about to assault her.I did not know how to call the police for them. I had to call another hotel asap and made a reservation through Expedia immediately and then called the hotel directly to get a room available no matter the price (the date of that night was not available through the website as it was pretty late). The hotel said they had a room and I asked the gentleman I spoke with at the hotel to call a taxi and have it take the lady and the kid to safety. Resolution: Air BnB refuses to refund me the full charge of a service fraudulently booked through their platform: these are some of the responses they provided: 1.  ""Just to let you know I can request to consider an additional refund but the service fee is non-refundable"".2. We are really sorry for the inconvenience. However, we don't process any refund for transaction done outside the Airbnb platform. We always encourage our all users to use the platform for any payment related. This is visible to our platform: ¨To protect your payment, never transfer money or communicate outside of the Airbnb website or app.¨Air BnB should be shutdown. It is a fraudulent company. The company is as fraudulent as the hosts who are not vetted properly. Book at your own risks. Be warned. Hotels, although a bit more expensive (and not by much) provide a far greater protection and safety to the guests; plus, they always honor business best practice with high customer satisfaction. #Cancel AirBnB"

Prior to our arrival, we saw new negative reviews. We contacted the host who assured us that all was in working order. We get to the home, and the air conditioning wasn't working. The host sent a repair man out to the home who entered while we were at the beach. The puppy escaped, and was found dead several days later. We never confirmed the repair appointment, the home owner assured us all was in working order prior to arrival, and now, airbnb and the host refuse to take responsibility. Airbnb should vet their owners and actually inspect the homes, especially if they have several negative reviews. Instead of this being the case, this host was able to post the same property under multiple listings - both with negative reviews. We are heartbroken, and this could have been avoided. We are obviously upset with this entire situation, but infuriated with how it is being handled in the aftermath. Please be aware of your rights and avoid AIRBNB at all costs."

And the bungalow we booked via Airbnb is far from good. (Libertas Villas in Paleloni, watch out!!)We booked a basic bungalow, but here are some of the things (describing everything is just impossible) which are wrong with it: the floor has water damage so the laminate floor is bubbly and very dangerous for your bare feet, chipboard outside tables and the airco only works in the living room so we are literally sleeping/“camping” in the living room. I know I booked basic but this bungalow is ready for renovation and should not be rented out to guests. I’ve contacted Airbnb and the only thing they do is string me along and don’t get a solution. All I hear is “we are sorry you have such a bad experience and of course we can help you out” I was asking for a solution to stay somewhere else also an Airbnb host. I’ve booked many times via Airbnb and have good reviews and also left good reviews about hosts so you’d think Airbnb would take this in consideration but they don’t. It’s just bad luck and you can kiss your money goodbye. So if the accommodation is fine Airbnb is happy to take a large chunk of your money for “service” but if it turns out you have a complaint you can get a big FY, because their real customers are the hosts not the guests."

The host of this property She has fabricated the description of the property from saying is a chalet and infact its a caravan.1)On arrival the caravan was dirty on the out side and in.2) Drink glasses with wine in them left in cupboard.  Dirty pots and pans and no dishes for oven all knobs broken on cooker. Fridge in side was broken and doesn't get cold.3) a mirror that should be over fire place is on the floor. Fire doesn't work.4) broken toilet lid which they were aware of before we arrived.5) broken patio walking into caravan that I fell on . My son fell in lake as the ground work is not stable.6 )no light bulb to lamp in living room7) dirty carpet and chair. The sofa smelt 8) dining room table  2  chairs  sleeps ,6 people. 9 dirty linen and quilt. We eventually got a new quilt.10) a real potent musky smell.We notified  the host. She never  say sorry but said someone will come to fix it tomorrow. We thought  that was the case we left the keys in the key safe for her. She never turned up.We tried to call her on our return to caravan that day.  The call wouldn't go through she blocked my number. When we tried on my daughter's phone it  went straight through.I could hear her tone on the phone very rude telling us if it's that bad get out.This was in an evening with no where to go but home and this was our holiday after such a long lockdown. The children was excited.  She spoke so badly and then put the phone down .  Air BnB reassured us they will deal with it and on our three way conversation with host myself and Air BnB nothing was dealt infact air BnB said they are coming to fix problems when we leave and that the host wants to pay for the dish we bought missing out every thing else we high lighted.This caravan was mis sold to us which air BnB has had many complaints about this host now we  are able to see  this host's reviews we found. On some of the same issues. They failed to stop this from happening time after time. Now a customer is hurt are they are  able  to take it serious. We will take the necessary steps that this never  happens again and the regulation and risk assessments were were not followed or addressed to bring this property to level of safety.Can I say on arrival we had to clean it and we left it as clean  disregarding what was already there!

He was a micromanager who wanted everything done his way (call, don't text. Stop here, not there. Give me your full attention right now. Respond to me right now) and just had a weird vibe. But it wasn't horrible until he entered the property when we weren't there to get a vacuum cleaner, then denied that he was there. (He said the day before that he might come and get it for another guest at another site, so who else would want it?) Not cool. We don't know what he was doing or what he was looking at while we were gone. We decided to leave early, and this is where the fun begins. He writes me a nice review. My review isn't mean, but it is factual. He gets his feelings hurt and retaliates with another multi-message rant about how I am weak and everything is my fault. He refers to a previous guest where he says ""I will know not to have any more non-native English speakers as guests."" (I am brown skinned. He is not), then tells me he will be praying for me.Alright, so I report this to AirBnB and guess what they do? First of all, they do NOTHING about his entering into the property without our knowledge or consent. That's not even mentioned. Then they delete my review. So, this guy gets to continue his abusive, racists ways AND is listed as a super host. WTH? Shame on you AirBnB. They say they ""care"" about racism. No, they don't. This guy's been openly bigoted since 2014 and he's still hosting. I've used AirBnB a LOT. Every other experience has been fair to very positive.

After I requested a refund host wrote false review, but AirBnb would not remove it, even though it comes from a person who obviously makes false claims, like one  that place is desinfected and clean. Stay away from Airbnb. They don't care about your safety!"

I've been calling for weeks and they do not respond, they do not care I've submitted a complaint to the BBB and they still have not responded with any explanation and instead have messaged the BBB with ""He's working with our support team"" All a bold face lie.

Instead he is covered by extenuating circumstances, that it is an emergency. How come the host is expected to cover the full cost of his holiday (i.e. setting the house up, and not being able to re-let at short notice) for his misfortune? There are no guarantees that guests have to be vaccinated, so for all we know he could have declined a vaccine. Air B n B seems to be the only platform operating this punitive system. Covid is a known, it is not an emergency, and we are not in lockdown. I want other hosts to read about this experience, because it is shocking and has cost us well over £1,000. I will not touch them again until they introduce a fairer system, i.e. hosts cancellation policy. Covid is a known, it is a risk, and that risk has to lie with the person taking it, or at very least be shared."

If your Host cancels your home (the one you made months in advance) two weeks before your trip, Airbnb will refund your money. Then, when you discover there is no similar place to stay at a comparable price … well, tough luck. The cancellation by our host in Boston has resulted in nearly a $1000 increase in expenses for housing at a place that is not nearly what we wanted or as nice as what we had reserved.The customer service agent simply kept repeating from his script that he “understood my frustration but there was nothing more he could do” than refund my original payment. It isn’t like he didn’t know what my rebooking cost as I rebooked through Airbnb.I asked to simply not have additional costs as a result of their host canceling and he just kept repeating his scripted language.  This is definitely something to be aware of when booking reservations as it would not happen at a hotel or bed and breakfast.  I do not know if VRBO has similar policies but is seems to me to be a horrible way to run a business."

To be short we booked a non-existing apartment in Poland and we got spammed with AirBnB contradictory emails stating that the apartment is booked, and not booked, is confirmed and not confirmed, available and not available. Up until midnights we were  calling support and the host to find out if we have a place to stay or not with no avail, and finally we gave up and booked another apartment from another website and spent the night. The day after we called AirBnB and they were kind enough to say SORRY and assure us that we will get refunded with a 10% discount coupon for our next booking within a month above the same amount and many more one sided/useless discount rules and regulations. AirBnB also assured us that the irresponsible host will get many penalties which will make AirBnB rich, but unfortunately does not give a dam about our ruined vacation. I asked if the same 10% deduction rule applies to late cancellation, but they said no, it is 100% deduction for late cancellation and 10% useless discount plus going through many troubles for getting refund is what one gets if it is AirBnBs fault.Overall a terrible experience, I suggest avoiding AirBnB and looking for alternatives which are much cheaper and reliable as per my empierce."

730,Jade Alexis,US,1 review,"Thursday, July 29, 2021, 05:28:22 PM",1,STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!,"Majority of my friends use Airbnb with no issues, so go figure it was my luck to experience what I did. Wait until you hear this. First and LAST time I will ever use Airbnb. This company is NOT reputable and completely unsafe based on their business practices. I created an account looking for a place to stay 8 nights in Orlando for a vacation with my mother and 11 year old daughter for the 4th of July weekend (7/4 - 7/12). We ended up booking a 2 bedroom apartment in Orlando. The name of the host was Marsha when booking. 2 days after booking, and the exception of the booking, the name of the host changed to Foreign. My gut told me something suspicious was going on (and I was right) but I decided to let it fly because I did not know how this all worked. After repeated attempts to contact the host on the app about check in procedures, they texted my personal number, which I read was a ""no-no"" based on Airbnb policies. Basically, we arrived in Orlando around check in time and I message the host letting them know I was in Orlando and headed to the apartment. Received no response. I then message them when we arrive. Again no answer so I decided to call, no answer a 3rd time. I waited about 5 minutes and then I get a text message on my personal cell phone from the host stating that their ""maid left the apartment key inside the place after cleaning it"" and the host didn't have another key and asked I check in the next day instead. Pissed off completely, I immediately called Airbnb and complained that I had no place to stay because the host was acting suspicious and has been for quite some time. After being on the call for about an hour, I was forced to find a hotel room to stay at for the night, mind you, it's 4th of July, a major holiday for Orlando! I was lucky to find something last minute but was forced to pay $250 for a room for the night. Airbnb said they would refund my 1 night for the apartment I paid for and would provide me an addition 50% of payment to help cover hotel expenses. The person I spoke to was also trying to get me to rent something cheaper than $250. So they basically wanted me to go to a dumpy, pay by the hour, hooker, cockroach and bedbug infested place with my 11 year old to appease their reimbursement funding. NO THANKS! Later that night, I message Airbnb letting them know I was NOT comfortable keeping the reservation with the host based on their behavior. Airbnb basically told me too bad and I was going to have to forfeit the money I paid or stay at the place the host provides me the following day. While I was asleep in the hotel for the first night, Airbnb did a further investigation and found the host to be fraudulent and then ended up refunding me for the entire 8 night stay and canceled my entire trip and provided a few places to stay in exchange for what was canceled but non of the options provided were close to where I needed to be or 2 bedrooms. They told me that if these options didn't work then to look at hotels because of the holiday and they would look into additional compensation for hotel room. I ended up finding a resort (with 1 room left) so I booked it immediately. I ended up spending an extra $1000 on this place because it was the only thing available to use with what we needed. I provided the hotel & resort receipts to Airbnb and opened another case with them expecting them to review it and provide me the additional 50% reimbursement for the resort room I was forced to get because of their fraudulent host. After about a week of no reply from them, I called and spoke to an agent that basically said I was SOL and that fraudulent hosts are common because they use the honor system and go based off good faith. Like what? So you can basically allow a pedophile to rent out fake rooms and endanger guests? That's absolutely terrifying. I still never received the additional reimbursement from my first night (50%) and they rep was supposed to get back to me about potential additional reimbursement on the resort I had to pay for but she never got back to me either. I've been back from my vacation for 3 weeks no with no resolution. I don't understand how a company could allow these types of hosts to scam their guests and then expect the guest to find their own accommodations on the fly and not assist with additional compensation. They have TERRIBLE business practices and should be shut down immediately!"

We could not attend our booking, due to covid guidelines not allowing groups from more than 6 households to mix. The host was informed as soon as we knew, but she refused to fully refund us. Not only this but she suggested that all guests in our 16-strong party attend anyway, which would have been breaking the law.When we flagged this with Airbnb, they were not interested. We were being encourage to break covid laws and risk a fine - but Airbnb simply said they could not help us lodge a formal complaint.We are not being offered either: - the service that was promised- any alternative suitable dates from the hostany helpful backup from AirbnbWe did not cancel the booking at the last minute - the UK covid guidelines meant that we could not attend. This was beyond our control. As the conversation went on, we were told on multiple occasions by the host to come anyway. She accused our lead Booker of trying to wriggle out of paying! Her (illegal at the time in the UK) suggestions including telling us to keep in two groups and stay in separate parts of the house. Eventually she encouraged us to drop some guests and invite random family members in order to keep within guidelines and still attend. She simply cared about making money. If you are considering booking with Stevie in Oxford, please consider carefully whether you are willing to risk your money. Airbnb are still being beyond unhelpful and our complaints just go to a customer care team that are not equipped to deal with big issues. When requesting a postal address we are given a US postal address. They are not interested in helping us recover our money.I would NEVER use this company again!"

Our whole trip was reliant on this stay and due to the refund taking up to 8 days to return to our account we are now out of pocket and struggling to find another place to stay as its too short notice. When contacting customer services they had no resolution other than to wait for the refund and offered no means of compensation or formal complaints procedure. We are also not able to leave a review with the host that cancelled as our booking was not completed and we didnt stay with them however I want to warn people of our situation and the hassle that we've been through to ensure our trip will still go ahead. We were looking forward to seeing family we hadnt seen in over a year and with working for the NHS I've been unable to get time off until now but this has cast a shadow over the trip. This has really upset us and with no resolution or formal complaint process I'm highly disappointed in the feedback procedure and lack of consideration airbnb have for guests.

Wow! amazing service of yours!!!During few times of using Airbnb for my trips, I have never encountered any line of information anywhere through my buying journey!!! that I am not allowed to reserve on behalf of family members or a friend. how many people would go among tons of articles in FAQ before booking a place?Never in the description part (like information about refund policies) or in the buying steps. On most of other online platforms who provide travel services there exist such a question for example, booking.com, or flixbus asks if you are the passenger or not? I believe at least in one of the steps before finalizing the purchase, there should have been such a notice in form of a question or alert, or filling tab! Moreover, while I was surfing in the room description page, as soon as I pushed the bottom of reservation, they took the money out of my PayPal account!!! without any second confirmation or even bothering to ask for information check, or asking in a pop-up window or even check the detail of guests!! what if it was my child using my phone whose mistakenly pushed the bottom!! the price was more than 1300 Euros which is more than basic income in many part of Euro. there should undoubtedly be a double verification for such amounts!! I used Airbnb platform 3 times and two of them was awful. Absolutely horrible experience through my journey with Airbnb.

The description and photos were beautiful, but the reality completely another story. The house was in extremely poor and dangerous conditions. As a family with small children, among which one who is only 2 years old, many of the issues with this property represented a dangerous threat.  From rotten wood floors, broken doors, shattered plug covers with visible electrical wires to cracked brick floors, this house should have never been rented in these conditions. The pictures of the property promised a fabulous vacation and I could not imagine finding a dirty neglected house with hazards for my toddler everywhere. -	Broken mosquito door that led to the garden with the pool had sharp wooden splinters sticking out and the damaged metallic net had sharp edges.-	Broken stairs with wood splinters at the entrance.-	Damaged outlets with exposed wire.-	Broken little bricks (creating dangerous holes for a walking toddler) on the way to the pool.-	Instead of leather sofa in the living room (as per website pictures) there was an upholstered sofa, very dirty and damaged and foam exposed through holes.The condition of the house in general was disturbing:-	Dirt was everywhere: piles of dust in the corners, dirty cushions and upholstery in the living and TV room, sticky oily rails on the stairs, sticky dirty plastic chairs, etc…-	Our guests found used towels with stains in one of the bathrooms.-	Dirty mattresses with stains (we saw them as per house rules we had to take off the bedding when leaving).-	Even though the owner told us on the phone that they regularly make disinfestations of insects it was hard to use the pool and the garden (which is the only beautiful part of the property) because horseflies and mosquitoes were there in flocks waiting to attack. We all have been bitten countless times, but children suffered the most.-	There were signs of mold present everywhere outside on the house walls and ground, which should be power washed and deep cleaned by people that care to do job up to standards. -	In the description of the property, they say that the little house in the garden can be used as a 4th bedroom BUT a very strong smell of naphthalene (or similar), dirt and overwhelming quantities of dead and alive insects in that little house made it, quite frankly, impossible. We realized that the naphthalene smell came from balls that were in a plastic bag (tucked behind a surfboard) when one of the kids found and held them in his hands (extremely dangerous).-	Strong smell of sewer and huge number of insects always present in the pool house making impossible to use it-	Old dirty air conditioners that had moldy smell and were whirring loudly when turning on keeping us awake at night. We had no choice but to shut off the conditioners to have some sleep and it was 80F outside…3 days of heat wave.A month before our arrival I wrote an email to the owner asking him if it was possible to change the air condition filters at my cost before our check in as we have one person (a kid) with a precondition and currently it is known that Covid-19 transmission is mostly airborne, so the air filtering system is very important. He replied: “The AC units are being re-installed on Friday to include new filters. They will not need replacing in a month. If you want to replace the filters upon arrival, I will leave this with you.” However, the AC units were old and smelly when we arrived, and I believe they don’t even have filters that could be replaced. The host knew that we have kids but chose to turn blind eye and keep it quiet about the issues or maybe he is in complete denial about the property condition.I spent several days creating a claim and describing ALL the issues, AIRBNB resolution team made me wait 3 weeks and at the end replied that I had to inform them within 24 hours about any issue I had and now they can't help me with anything."

I always read the reviews but gave it the benefit of the doubt as the place had only been on air B and B for less than a month and the pictures of the place were decent enough considering our value for money( in hindsight good lighting and angles tbh) Opened the front door and the first thing we noticed was the smell in the place.(this was fine after we opened some windows and came back a few hours later- only for the fact it had been raining and the suitcase under the skylight we opened had drowned all the clothes(our fault sure but we wouldn’t have opened windows if it hadn’t smelled when we got there) Initially walking in it didn’t seem too bad but when u looked a little closer there was hair and very tiny insects in the shower. Cobwebs on the skylighht. A stain on the sheets(could have been clean sheets, stain none the less). A smell from the pillows ( that pungent smell when u leave the clothes sitting in the washing machine for a few days damp) we ended up going to Penney’s and buying pillows sheets and covers and duvets, just to feel more comfortable in the space. there was clothes left in the dryer and clothes left hanging on clothes horse. ( okay fine not the End of the world) when we pinned back the sheet on the bed to change the bedding there was a dead earwig on the mattress so I thought I’d flip it but the underside of the mattress had a huge stain on it so decided against it. We supposedly had a car park we could park in but couldn’t as the batteries were dead for the fob to get in. The host was friendly on the phone and suggested he would reimburse us for parking elsewhere ( yet to see if that occurs) was just a combination of little things like the multiple bird poos on the seating outside and cigarette buts on the ground combined with all mentioned above that would make ur skin crawl getting into the beds in the night. Luckily i had only booked 2 nights, and realised the pillows smelled before going to bed before that night to fix it myself. We didn’t use the showers (4 of us stayed) and this was our first and last experience booking with air B and B. I had not done research before hand (usually would) and booked last minute job. Have looked into it since current experience and can see now when it goes wrong for people it can be a s**t show not worth the risk. Location was great in the city but Cleanliness let it down BIG TIME. The main thing you care about when staying somewhere let’s be honest. A lot of other things are forgivable but people should know what they are chancing going with Air B and B, putting trust into host and if anything goes wrong a big ordeal speaking to air B and B to get support, if you get it at all."

Since the end of lockdown, we have stayed in lots of Airbnb places and have found them to be OK. That is, until we stayed in a place last weekend for four days with our toddler - a place that was appallingly dirty (called Heaven's Edge Stroud). The accommodation didn't even have a proper front door and the owner was worryingly odd. We wasted many hours speaking to nine people at Airbnb, each of whom seem to be in a different country and each promised to resolve it, including offering us much better accommodation at Airbnb's expense. Naturally, this did not happen and we had to fight to get partial compensation for the filthy conditions that we endured, which we eventually got. The combination of weird landlord and useless Airbnb staff genuinely ruined our holiday. Airbnb has had lots of money in platform fees from us. We won't touch them again. Caveat emptor..."

In August 2020 I accepted a booking from an airbnb'er with 8 perfect guests reviews. He had agreed to our 'over 25 year old only, no parties, no same sex groups' policies. It turns out there were 7 young men aged 18-20 (Airbnb does not provide this type of information) and one 25 year old (primary guest). I knew nothing about the additional young men until I had accepted the booking request, the house being available due to a late covid cancellation. The primary guest then advertised my house on Instagram for a 24hr/7day Pool and Sex Party with free alcohol for girls (we found advertising flyers in the house afterwards). Due to Covid, I was stuck 1000km away unable to travel and so oblivious to what was happening, until the third day when the Spanish Guardia Civil contacted me after a neighbour complaint. I involved Airbnb who did help and evicted the guests, although not quickly enough for the neighbour it seems as another all night party happened. Airbnb told me that they would help with this as Airbnb House Parties were a big problem (shortly after this Airbnb introduced new rules to stop them, however our primary guest would still get through these new restrictions).6 weeks ago the consequences of this Airbnb Pool /Sex Party became apparent, I am now being taken to court in Spain as I am held 100pct responsible for the Airbnb'er guest actions. In 2020 we bought the house in Spain for our retirement (it was only on airbnb because we lost all our income due to covid), our own home in France is being sold and completes in October, but now, I cannot go to Spain as I will have to go to court to defend myself. If I stay out of Spain I cannot be taken to court. My husband and I will be homeless as we cannot pull out of our house sale without paying 70K in compensation if we withdraw.Even if our neighbour withdraws the court proceedings we will have neighbours who hate us for our retirement, which is not a pleasant thought. I have contacted him to discuss (having of course apologised profusely at the time), but his reply was that he was a 'civilised person who lived in a civilised country' implying that we were not. He gave no indication of what he hoped to achieve by this or if he actually wanted anything. It seems he has not realised that if we cannot live in our retirement home, because I have a police record and cannot apply for Spanish residency, then the house will remain a holiday home (albeit no longer advertised on airbnb but on sites which provide a better quality of guest).Airbnb will not respond to my emails. I must now pay for a lawyer to help me clear up this mess.This is just a warning of what can happen if you host and what does happen when things go wrong."

Unfortunately I tested positive for Covid-19 both via Antigen & PCR test 2 days before departure (wich is tomorrow)The 3 others I had planed to travel with, have luckily not been in physical contact with me, during my period of infection. They can therefore of course still be staying in the Airbnb.I therefore contact Airbnb Support and explain my situation where my goal is, to get some sort of compensation for us leaving 3 insted of 4 people. I suggest the compensationn to be either in cash or a voucher. Right away, the Airbnb support team reject this, and tells me I should contact the ""Superhost"", and that they will contact him aswell. This i find not much helpful. I then contact the host myself, with the message below:""Regarding 60 Apartment Lemon 1 Luxury on the beachHi Fabio,I texting you because I was supposed to check in to wonderful place at Rua Coronel Águas 22, Albuferia, Faro in Portugal.Unfortunately, today I tested positive for COVID 19, as you can see on the pictures I sent you. Therefore I'm not able to be staying there. Luckily the 3 other people I should have traveled with, have not been in physical contact with me within the last 14 days.

This means that in future I will NEVER use Airbnb again, and also advise my network not to either. However, Airbnb Support should be rewarded for their quck responses on the chat - but not for the outcome.I hope, that either the host or Airbnb reads this and understands the situation.

766,Madison Nichols,US,1 review,"Friday, July 23, 2021, 07:05:21 AM",1,Absolutely ridiculous experience,"I would never book with Airbnb again for many reasons. For one the ridiculous policy where you have to wait 24 hours from when the agent contacted the host to fix an issue to get a 50% refund on the first night of our stay. We had contacted our host the first day of our stay to fix the issue and she said she would but then later that night said she was unable to because of a family emergency. The issue with the Airbnb was that it was very dirty and we were forced to stay there the first night because of how late the host told us she was unable to clean the home. The next day I spent from basically 8am-4pm trying to resolve this issue with Airbnb support to help us find a new place to stay which was already ridiculous and ruined one day of the trip not including the first night we spent in that Airbnb. I was then told we would have to pay for the first night and a fee as well as pay the difference for another last minute Airbnb that was more expensive because most everything in the area was booked. I told the agent that was ridiculous because we had given the host the opportunity to clean the place and she was unable to and he said the only other option was to wait 24 hours from when the agent contacted the host that morning at 8am to fix the issue and if they didn't get back to us then we'd get the 50% refund but would still be paying the difference on whatever Airbnb we found in the area we were needing to stay. Plus that would mean spending another night in a gross Airbnb if she didn't clean it which at this point considering the host hadn't contacted either me nor the agent from that 8am-4pm period (I also hadn't heard from her since her last message the night before) it was pretty fair to assume that the family emergency she had going on was pretty serious. The whole handling of the situation by Airbnb was completely ridiculous and I ended up just paying the extra money because I refused to sleep in a room with hair everywhere and mysterious stains on the soft surfaces. But I did not go with another Airbnb with the refund instead opting for a hotel because of how late it then was to be finding a place to stay that night. If you remember from what I said earlier this was finally sorted out at 4pm because after I first contacted support and they told me they would update me it took them until 3:30pm to get back to me after I messaged. I ended up calling support again where I was told my case manager would call me right back and I waited another hour from that point for that call. By the end of the ordeal I also was just so done with how the situation was handled by the company I didn't want to give them a penny more of my money so ended up paying for a hotel. The whole thing ruined the first part of my trip and I'm still furious about how we were basically forced to choose between sleeping in an unsanitary environment or not getting a refund one our first night (which was only a partial refund at that). Never ever, ever, ever booking Airbnb again after this. Ever. P.S. I didn't even go into everything on this just the worst parts it would have taken too long and this was already long."

Contacted airbnb and the host in Tokyo more than 24 hours before the check in time. I was told they would do everything to help me. I didn’t hear back from either for more than 46 hours despite constant attempts to contact. Even though their policy clearly states if notified 24 hours you will get a free refund due to travel disruptions caused by weather I was given the run around and avoided by both staff at Airbnb and the host. I am still waiting another 15 hours now for an update. I have lost the funds from the entire 5 day booking and both the host and Airbnb continue to avoid their responsibilities. I will be filing a complaint with Consumer Affairs Association.  Save the headache and just get a real hotel. This company has no honesty or integrity towards guests or hosts in my opinion.

I just tried to book a place in a popular beach town for next summer. I went to reserve and it said will get a response within 24 hours if the reservation is accepted. I  got a message that host could not accommodate my reservation because they usually block my week out or may be off the app by my time frame and they had forgot to update availability. I was like okay, fair enough. But then when I  went to check those dates again that place still comes up at twice the price. At this point I  don't feel Ilike I can trust Air B and B and their booking process for this trip."

779,Mary  Cureton,US,4 reviews,"Monday, July 19, 2021, 05:30:13 PM",1,Air b&b is terrible,"We stayed at a very substandard misrepresented home through air b&b.  I was in Bend for my daughter’s wedding. They refused to address any of my very serious complaints (misrepresented as tolerable when it was very hot but was actually unusable and never cooled down; my grand daughters had to sleep on the living room floor because the bunk bed room was so hot and the window was inadequate to let even hot air in, auto locks on both bathroom slider doors malfunctioned and trapped members of our party in interior bathrooms, door to attached garage would not go down so no security whatsoever!) My daughter, whose wedding we were there to attend,  made the reservation and paid the fee on our behalf but registered us all (including me) as guests. ( We could not even begin to use the home during the day and it wasn’t much better at night!)We were given the confirmation number and required to register on the site to confirm.  We did.  Yet they refused to handle the complaints unless she personally made it even though she did not stay there snd was herself not registered as a member of the guests staying in the home.  This house was $2200 for five days snd was so hot at check in we could not even go inside at 4:00 in the afternoon snd unlike the host had specifically said, never cooled down.  We could not even use a portion of the home because of the heat snd closing it up as the host claimed would keep it cool during the day made it even worse if that was even possible.  Ruined the week for all of us.  I could not even get dressed there let alone sleep! We had a 6 week old grand baby with us, snd the host knew that very young children were in our party when he misrepresented this hone to us.  Air b&b would not even register my complaints.  They said my daughter (on her honeymoon then) whose wedding they already negatively impacted would have to complain or they would not address.  They should have given her a full refund along with a letter of apology and a complimentary dinner for two!  I’ll never use their services again."

On booking a room in Barkingside, Ilford Essex, outside London and after travelling 7 hours from Scotland, I arrived at the address, the host was 10 minutes away, I called, and they were helpful in instructing where to park etc... I walked up to the door and found a not very welcoming sight, a soiled mattress propped up adjacent to the main door and mess strewn across the entrance. I decided then this was not for me, i never crossed the threshold, if a host thinks this standard was acceptable then I shudder to think what other standards awaited me. I emailed the company to cancel my booking. I could not get a proper resolution to my complaint, messages from bots that was a time-wasting exercise, messages from staff confirming that i would be contacted... nothing. I then received aggressive messages from the host directly to my phone and not via the app as was the procedure. I was told if I wanted quality then i should book a room at the RITZ. I would never attempt to book a room with ABB, their generic approach to customer complaints is papering over the cracks of poor customer care."

I was traveling with 4 small children and had car trouble. All nearby hotels were full and I was beginning to panic but realized I had the AirBNB. I opened the app showing my profile, previous stays, etc. I was relieved that there was a lot of availability and I thought it would be ok. Sadly I was so wrong and it just got worse. I kept getting an error message when trying to pay explaining that my validation wouldn’t be completed in time to reserve. Shortly after that I got an email asking to submit my ID (as I did years prior). I immediately took the photos of my ID and submitted but this never fixed the error message. Panicking I tried at least 20 times and just kept getting the error message. Ultimately the kids and I had to sleep on the side of the road. I tried again the next day only to get the same error. I used the help feature (should be changed to no-help) and either it’s just a bunch of automated responses or the reps have no clue what they are doing. I was then told that I was under a periodic review and there was nothing anyone could do about it and I can’t rent until it’s done (no one could tell me when it would complete). I was dumbfounded. They could clearly see I am a real person with real reviews from those I have rented from. I have never had a prior issue or complaint and they can’t answer any of my questions?? I clearly understand the need to screen and I get that. I am most concerned with the lack of resolution as well as the lack of prior communication from AirBNB advising to update or verify my information in order to prevent this from ever happening in the first place. I mean they send me promotional emails all the time but I guess it was to hard to send such a important notification as this."

I booked a family vacation trip in April 2021 for July 2021, I paid what I believed to be the total amount of $877 for a 2 bdrm deluxe suite at a resort, after paying for the resort in April anytime I contacted the host ANASTASIA she replied to me within minutes.  Fast forward 3 days before my trip I get an email saying I need to pay an extra $720, when I contacted Anastasia to ask about the outlandish fee, she didn't respond to me. I contacted airbnb and they were rude unprofessional and not very helpful. They told me if I didn't pay the extra money the host would cancel my reservation and I wouldn't be refunded due to their cancellation policy.  The same policy that the host violated by not contacting 7 to 10 days before my trip.  I paid the extra $720, because I didn't want to ruin my children's vacation (remember all this is happening 3 days before my trip).  Now get to the day before my trip and I get an email ANASTASIA the host canceled my trip she issued my credit card with the first payment from April $877 a full refund, gave me no explanation why she canceled the day before. I had to call my bank to reverse the charges of $720 off my other credit card, because once again when I called airbnb they were no help and unapologetic.  THANK goodness for TRAVELOCITY my trip is still on at another resort.  I will NEVER use airbnb again, that was my first and last time. Anyone going to Florida beware of dealing with ANASTASIA, what she did was wicked and airbnb give host like her a green light to prey on people by putting them in vulnerable positions to get as much money as they can. Lucky for me I kept every email from April up to July so I will be fully refunded no thanks to Anastasia or airbnb because they tried to keep the $720. ."

To top it off, everything is booked so we cant even go on a planned trip.We lost money spent not only on excursions reserved and paid for in advance, car rental and other expenses totally over $4000.

My gripe is with Airbnb and their customer services. We had to cancel our trip to France due to Covid in 2020. Airbnb, I thought, had a great policy of offering credit, to be used as and when we could travel. Well 18 months on I am ready to book for 2022 and use my credit of over £1k. Unfortunately this credit has a sell by date of 31/12/2021, so if I don’t use it by then I lose it. So Airbnb basically want to blackmail me into using my own money by a deadline or they are going to steal my £1k that they have already collected interest on for 18 months, so i have spent 8 hours online with Airbnb chat bot speaking to advisors, who tell me they are getting advice from supervisors, leaving me hanging for upto 1 hour Intervals because they are checking with a supervisor, honestly this company is incompetent at best. Anyway I sorted issue myself with a lovely host, I booked for 2021, credit was applied, then I amended booking to change dates, voila, simples. Never had an issue with hosts, but Airbnb you need a good talking to and regulation would be good."

I pushed further, telling them it was not negotiable and they eventually gave a actual refund.Hotels.com or Booking.com give full refund for refundable stays (up to a deadline), so why can't AirBnB do the same (or at least be more transparent at the time of booking)??Given the current Covid conditions and daily changing circumstances, they really need to have proper flexibility and clear T&Cs if they want people to book anything..."
799,John Hostler,GB,5 reviews,"Thursday, July 15, 2021, 11:10:13 AM",1,Self Contained Flat,"In June this year I booked a nice flat in Devon for a week. The host was Jolanta, and the address was 4, Cecil Place, Plymouth.I published a review on Airbnb, and was promptly notified (by an unknown/ unnamed authority, Ms. No Name.) that it had been removed because it transgressed their review policy. The truth of it is, that within the review, I included factual things which presumably were taken as negatives, and might affect future bookings. I used no swear words, my review also gave positives. I stated in the review that my account was to assist in further improving the accommodation. This is a summary of what I wrote:From a Covid perspective, very clean and sanitary. A co-op store, well stocked too, just 2 minutes from the flat. Very handy!The small garden and entrance was full of weeds, and the door frame was rotting.The flat had an old feel about it, tired appearance, but in no way detracted from the overall cleanliness. In fairness, Jolanta does record in her account that the carpets have seen better days.Broadband was useless, if like me you wished to stream Netflix or Sky, forget it. I recorded 6 to 8 Mgbs on a speed check. I checked every day and it never reached double figures. Useless! Some might question why you watch TV on holiday, well in the UK inclement weather is always a possibility.In the kitchen, I found months old out of date food. I pointed out in the review that I knew the host has no responsibility to provide stuff, spices etc, but surely has a responsibility to clean out these things. I have photos of a dirty sugar jar, contaminated sugar, also I'd forgotten to buy a jar of coffee, but seeing some on the shelf was a bonus. I took off the lid, and only a congealed lump of instant was inside. All of the spices were months, some years, out of date. Disgusting, and the flat is supposed to be professionally cleaned!I don't know the rules, eg distance from City centre to the holiday let, but I questioned the description ""central"". As far as I am concerned, it's not.The road out side the flat is incredibly steep, but parking isn't an issue if you're a competent driver.The road surface is in third world condition, absolutely awful, chunks of loose tarmac etc.I scored Jolanta's place 3 out of 5, but I am angry she has chosen to have my review removed. It's still a nice place to stay, but be aware of some issues is all. I've cancelled my Airbnb account, just another woke bunch of incompetents quite frankly. The woman I dealt with was quite rude, and I dislike being spoken to like a child.  Best intentions!"

Photos were a nightmare as it does not accept Apple's format of photographs and when converted, waited to be told they were rejected as they were too blurry.As a host, their feedback system is basically 5 stars for all guests but if you fail to dance to every tune of the guest, no matter how bad they are, your host status maybe removed. 5 stars are good, but it seems that what Airbnb's expectation is, if a guest gives 4 stars, then it's not looking good for hosts even if the host had issues. The system immediately drops you to below standard  for one review from previous 5 stars to just one 4 star review!This system is truly warped and it is clear that they do not think about the host that earns them their well paid commission on both host and guest  but creates a nonsensical feedback system which forces hosts to bend over backwards to obtain reward for their services despite not knowing facts for individual cases.  To me, it's pretty close to extortion.Fortunately, there are many alternatives now, so be aware that Airbnb will soon be history (especially with this line of feedback policy) as there are other companies that treat both the host and guest in equal fair terms.Biased, unfair but on the plus side - always nice on the phone"

After a host cancelled our stay with three weeks notice due to ""emergency maintenance"", in the height of the summer, leaving us with only one, double the price options to book... their solution was ""here's a $75 coupon for your next stay"" (which wasn't remotely close to covering the premium when you have to book another location 3 weeks out in July).When I tried to get help, it took over a week for them to respond with basically ""there is nothing we can do about it, please use your coupon"" at which time I already had to book somewhere else. Then apparently I didn't put the coupon code for the new stay in at the right time during the transaction, so I'm out of luck on that. ""Please use it right next time, there is nothing we can do about it now.""Oh and the original booking all of the sudden didn't need maintenance and wanted to know if we wanted to book with him again.TERRIBLE customer service. TERRIBLE understanding of customer lifetime value. Could not get someone on a phone, just all through delayed text messaging. We won't be back."

Their digital pathways are unreliable and their directions impossible to follow. I just wasted another 30 minutes on the phone with a rep who refused to provide TECH SUPPORT, claiming SHE WAS QUALIFIED TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM. She was not. She provided absolutely no help yet took 30 minutes to face the fact. Furthermore, I apparently following her exact directions I unfortunately lost many tabs I had open on Chrome that I now cannot retrieve. I was reluctant to do as directed but with NO TECH support, locked out of my host account and having only this person to rely on, followed her directions exactly. She was as ignorant as I am as to how to find a way through the digital maze and barriers set in place.  After I went through 30 minutes of the no-help-rep, she agreed to request -- not transfer me to or have them CALL ME, but send an email to""Technical support"" that I asked for at the onset and WAS REFUSED. I was forced to leap through hoops that were repetitive and of NO HELP IN GETTING ME TO MY HOST PAGE. Plus I'm logged out of over a dozen Chrome tabs I now need to spend more time on to recover. This is the SECOND TIME in the last few years that I have been suddenly locked out of access to my host account -- in this case apparently because Spectrum installed a new modem this afternoon.One wonders who they hire at Airbnb. I went through this SAME. AWFUL EXPERIENCE about a year ago with Airbnb, was shown a round-about ""work around way""by one rep to get to my host account and FINALLY after NUMEROUS CALLS GIVEN a SWITCH TO HOSTING link so I could proceed as a host. I have NEVER rented a single night's accommodation Airbnb and FOR YEARS HAVE LISTED my vacation rental on Airbnb. Yet they STILL shunt me onto the pathway of travelers.Another example: I just clicked on an email Airbnb sent saying to rate a recent guest. When I clicked to do so, it dead ended onto an Ooops -- no go page -- with a cute cartoon that may be their expertise -- that said I'd arrived at a wrong location with no option but to go back, which of course had no option but to go forward. And another example from the last 3 days: Could not find the Special Offer link to change the price for a guest. I challenge hosts to find theSpecial Offer button/link. That seems to be another insider secret.The rep helping me was doing her best. But she was obviously operating without the info she needed.  People at higher levels really need to shape things up.  PERMANENTLY -- no repeat errors programmed in -- quick fixes are not enough -- You need to get to the ROOT AND SEE TO IT THAT YOU DON'T LOCK OUT SUPERHOSTS -- leaving them unable to rate guests AS REQUESTED BY AIRBNB -- and UNABLE TO REACH THEIR ACCOUNTS without going through 30 minutes of OBVIOUSLY USELESS, UNQUALIFIED ""HELP"""

I have had to cancel yesterday  due to my father being poorly. The booking is not till the end of august so over 6 weeks notice what they don’t tell you is that when you cancel you only get less then half your money back I paid  £953.07 For the 5 day trip airB&b are only giving me £440 back. What’s worse is the host contacted me with regards to changing dates but by that time I already cancelled I informed her I was not getting all my money back to which she private messages me to say that if I rebook she will give me a 10% discount. As if I am going to rebook when I have lost over £500 due to the circumstances of my elderly father being poorly they would have more compassion. The point I’m trying to raise is read the small print when it advertises a 3 day cancellation policy don’t believe it. I now can’t book another holiday for them due to the loss in money."

Despite being a verified member through email, identification, photographs, and Google I was not able to book an apartment I found because my phone number changed. I had to wait over 24 hours to reattempt verifying my phone number after not receiving any verification codes to confirm my number. I spoke to a customer service representative and they told me that there's no way they can override these policies. Surprise surprise the apartment I had lined up was rented to someone else during this time. I also noticed there are some pretty heavy fees for Airbnb, and cleaning fees.I've had much better luck with booking.com or OLX which lists apartments in different parts of Europe such as Poland, Ukraine, etc. If you look ahead of time you will find much better deals elsewhere. Airbnb is one of the more expensive options when booking an apartment.Lessons learned. Luckily I was able to find another rental and actually save some money. I guess I have to thank Airbnb for being clowns because in the end I actually saved money. Thank you for not having any common sense. Unfortunately your clients renting apartments are missing out on money because of your uncaring policies that make no sense to a verified member."

The need to for an age limit of 25+ is ridiculous. Our accounts are verified so why should our age come into it? I have used Airbnb in the past and the idea that I can't book an entire property which is a student halls property during the summer. so it is not an entire place. It is a studio apartment, within a halls of residence. The next guidelines I do understand but there needs to be some lenience towards those of us who are genuine people who need a place to stay that is private, especially during the current global pandemic. I don't feel safe booking a private room in a house of someone I don't know. Revaluate your policies to accommodate the current global situation!"

We had a young child and we were sleepless/exhausted, hence we just endured the misery till it was over. I wrote a polite yet honest review and the host started harassing me via texts saying also that they will speak to Air Bnb. Couple days down the line a get a notification from Air BnB that my review was deleted! (without discussing or informing me first) They said it did not meet their policy requirements. Upon questioning further they claimed that the host can't do anything about the things I mentioned (!) That included an unsafe 2 floor staircase without railings. When I asked to amend my review and resubmit they refused. Upon asking for partial refund they also said that we should have contacted them on the first day of arrival. This is clear to me that the reviews are unreliable and the guests are censored. They have created questionable ""policies"" and in the slightest demand of the hosts, they find ways to delete reviews without allowing the other side to have a say.Appalling service, unsafe accommodation, terrible experience.

The cozy home-town partnership feeling is gone.   My recent frustration is 3 tiered. 1. I rent my vacation property by room, not per person.   Setting rates per person frustrates my guests, diminishes my profits, and confuses the process.   2.  Not being able to control damage deposits allows Airbnb to take months to reimburse for damage to homeowner's property. I have now been waiting 4 months to get $90 back for damaged towels. $90 is not a lot of money, but chasing $90 has become very expensive in terms of my time and resources. I think Airbnb holds these funds intentionally to maximize the interest they earn on holding reimbursement requests for as long as possible.  How can anyone, other than hosts that run enterprises with staff keep up with this for so long?  3. Finally, it has become almost impossible to actually speak with anyone that can actually offer assistance and solutions, rather than just coined apologies and promised escalations that lead nowhere.   My heart is broken because what started out as a very close synergistic business relationship, has turned into a one-sided relationship, with me as the silent partner.   I do not see how I can continue with Airbnb. I lose all the way around. Unfortunately, it will probably take a lawsuit to get Airbnb's attention, because my little voice means nothing to them."

I booked a private room in a residence in Colorado (4.79 stars from 58 reviews) in February for a girls trip in late June, paid in full ahead of time. When my (pregnant) cousin and I arrived, there was no answer at the door or on either phone number provided. After walking around the side of the house we found the doors open and the place left as if someone had just stepped out for a moment. The place was a mess and one of the beds was stripped (we could see in the windows, we did not go inside). We called the sheriff at that point for a welfare check as something seemed wrong. The Sheriff arrived after 30 minutes just as AirBnB called saying they had our host on the line, calling from a hospital room, wanting to give us instructions on how to get in. We were very relieved he was ok, but given the state of the house and the fact that the listing clearly stated the owner was required to be present whenever guests were there, we didn’t feel comfortable staying at the house. The Sheriff informed us that this was the second time this had happened in four months, went to close up the house and upon coming back informed us, we “Definitely did not want to stay there.” I got the sheriffs card and a incident report number. Upon calling Airbnb back, they said they could only put us up in a listing of similar cost and sent 5-6 properties all at least 1.5 hours away. The only listing left in the area (it’s peak season here) was an $800/night mansion. They refused to put us up, even for a night, but insisted it was not about money. We were left to find a hotel on our own. On our way out of town to a hotel we found available about an hour away (it’s getting dark, in the mountains), a friendly local waiter directed us to a street with some low budget hotels we should check out. Thankfully they had rooms and we were able to book for our four night stay at about $200/night. Still $130/more a night than our Airbnb booking and with no kitchen to use our $100 worth of groceries we’d brought with us as we had planned on staying somewhere with a kitchen. 2 star hotel, poor reviews, not a luxury hotel by far. After calling back and asking to be contacted by a manager or supervisor, I was told it would take 24-48 hours. No call for two days and on day 3 I got a call back from the original customer service agent. At this point I was so frustrated, didnt want to ruin the rest of my vacation, so I did not answer. To the Owners credit he contacted me the next day and said we could come back and stay at his place at no cost, but at this point we were settled in the non-refundable hotel and were not comfortable going back. At this point I did receive a full refund for the original purchase (slightly less than half the cost of the hotel). I called back the next weekend, was told they would call me back likely within the hour but no guarantees. Two days, no call. So I call again. Finally reach someone, they tell me to send a picture of the receipt. I do. 24 hours later they respond they can only refund 50% of the original amount booked. This would mean I’m still out $330 more than original booking price plus groceries and extra meals we had to eat out. However, given the situation and good faith efforts to find reasonable alternate accommodations, I should not be out any money at all. This is also eight hours of my time trying to work with them and getting zero useful assistance the night of the stay when it was most needed. I have zero confidence if I ever tried to use AirBnB in the future, got into town later in the evening in a similar or unsafe situation, that the company would do anything to help me find an alternate place to stay. As I put in my response to customer service, if this is not a situation where AirBnB should make things fully right, I don’t know what is."

Had a manager call me that was helpful and got fees and taxes refunded, but they had no recourse for compensating me for the host's charges. Basically, it is up to the host to refund your nightly rent and if they are unprofessional and don't want to, AirBnb has no recourse somehow.  Absolutely absurd!  The hosts are representing AirBnb and they should do more to take care of their guests.  On the converse, the AirBnb agent said they have no recourse against guests either if they trash a host's house.  Those are completely flawed policies.

There really is no point in their ""insurance"" because they refuse to pay for damages caused by guests during their stay. I will never host with Airbnb because of their horrible customer service when it comes to their insurance. They don't follow what is written in their own terms and conditions regarding their insurance.

We have rented privately in Australia snd America many times, but treated like potential criminals with air bnb. We won’t be trying again"

We had a couple come by our that stated that they purchased a night in our home but were never able to confirm it with the host or with AirBNB. I attempted to contact AirBNB customer service but pretty much got told that even though we OWN the home, we can't remove the listing because we don't OWN the account. If AirBNB sees this, I want you to know that this incident ended ok (probably going to lose those customers because of this) but if we have someone who ISN'T as understanding as before, and something bad happens to me, my parents, or my home, I will be pursuing legal action."

Airbnb does not make sure hosts actually own the house. We tried to book a house for a family reunion which included babies and grandparents. The host seemed nice, accepted our reservation, and took our money. A few months later we discovered the host sold the house and couldn’t be bothered to tell us. Airbnb offered to refund our money. Not very helpful when you’ve paid airfare and have no where to stay. Read their policy very carefully. Airbnb disclaims all responsibility. The company couldn’t careless if they ruin long anticipated family vacations or even cause children and elderly to sleep in cars."

It is very easy to click a button in error and woe betide you if you do so and if your Airbnb account is attached to your PayPal account because in the blink of an eye the money will have been taken and often in full. I inadvertently paid in full for a holiday cottage and my daughter was coincidentally looking at the owners website at the same time. The Airbnb price was £500 more than the price we would have paid via the owners website. Furthermore a full payment would not have been required at the time of booking via the owners, only a deposit would have been necessary. If you find a holiday, please come out of Airbnb and try book it directly with the owner/ company. You will save money and definitely receive better terms and customer service."

We then opened a ticket with AirBnb and further called their emergency phone number, specifically designed for such cases, and surprisingly - they did not pick up 5 or 6 times. This actually continued for 4 more days. No answering on the phone, no updates on the ticket. With all above being said, I would tell that to AirBnb: ""You could do much better""."

857,Sarah,GB,1 review,"Thursday, July 1, 2021, 11:06:55 PM",1,Disgrace of a Company,"As we know, a worldwide pandemic happened last year. It's still happening now. Amongst the grief and the fear for loved ones, there were a lot of smaller disappointments. Weddings postponed. Holidays cancelled. What did it matter? The world was turned upside down. But then people realised they were losing a lot of money. From their jobs, whether dismissed or furloughed. From trips they'd paid for well in advance, as they had no idea what was around the corner. They asked, as certain services were not, and could not, be supplied, whether they could have their money back. Airbnb, the multi-billion dollar company, said no. A partial refund only (sorry - what are people paying for? A few clicks on their app?) or vouchers that had to be used within a completely arbitrary timeframe. Okay, not great, but not terrible. Yet the pandemic and it's restrictions continue all over the world. Airbnb have stood FIRM. No, you MUST use your vouchers, even if you're NOT LEGALLY PERMITTED to travel yet. No, you cannot transfer your vouchers to someone that can use them. And yes, even if you CAN travel, AirBnB hold the right to cancel or evict you ON THE DAY, for NO REASON, without even a full refund. Absolutely disgusting. Disgraceful. I would literally rather sit on my derriere at home, drinking a can of cheap lager. Hey, if the lager's out of date or not sealed properly, at least I'd get my money back or an exchange. The little corner shop up my road is more honest than this farce of a business."

Everyone can become hosts as no one checks the apartment, I have stayed in some really bad and overpriced places as there is no one checking standards. Once I even stayed in a flat, where they didn’t think it’s adequate to leave a toilet paper in the bathroom. I basically had to go to a market to buy it after I had checked in.2. They never take sides so if you end up with bad guests, who damage your property you will be at a big loss as a host. One of my guests damaged a fridge with a hammer and didn’t take any responsibility. The fridge was almost 2k and I got back 180 Euros.3. My last call with the Airbnb customer service was a complete nightmare (a supper bad connection and a crying baby in the background). I asked a few times if someone else from the team can call me back but my request was completely ignored. On top of all that, I had a better understanding of how Airbnb works for a guest and a hosts than the customer service. I understand that working from home is the new trend even with restrictions easing but you still need to make sure that that your working environment stays professional and you are able to deal with you call."

Being stuck interstate we were forced to either change the dates of the air bnb booking or cancel. The host was unwilling to allow any change of dates and therefore we had to cancel taking a $500 loss after receiving 50% partial refund. Air bnbs covid policy is good if your booking is for the 30 days after March 2020.

When I contact the host, Liam, about re-reserving with the funds already paid (over $2800) for dates when tourism opens, which would be announced July 5, he told me I had 24 hours to say if we wanted new dates. How is that possible when we did not yet know what the government guidelines would be. We heard his sob-story about the pandemic and his money woes. We all have them, meanwhile, I haven't seen my daughter in a year, both her grandparents passed away and through no fault of our own, we have lost nearly $2000 because of Airbnb heartless policy and a completely unfeeling and cold host.

Used cash for one, credit (from prior cancellation) for the other. Home owner sold home so Airbnb cancelled on us for the Sept 2021 date. Now they refuse to reimburse the $3000. They will only provide credit. Also, absolutely no additional credit provided for the inconvenience of having to find a new venue on short notice. I do NOT want credit. I want reimbursement.

When I left, I forgot to grab my cosmetic case which was worth over $300.00 in cosmetics. I contacted Airbnb and received very little to no help. It was frustrating because they kept giving me the run around, calls would drop and calls would not be returned. You can chat with them thru the Airbnb with their so called specialist that do absolutely nothing for you. I lost my make up case, they never contacted me. Second house my daughter rented was for my grand daughter's birthday, it was a kids party and the pool was not working. It was disgusting!! No filtration, the water was stagnant and foggy. NO ONE used the pool. My daughter sent messages and finally they stated they would sent someone over which never came. Then the owner of the house failed to add my daughter and the guest to the guest list for that house and everyone who tried to go in was being harassed in an ugly manner by security and one security guard even showed us there was nothing showing as rented for that house. Trying to contact an owner thru Airbnb would be in vain and the Airbnb itself is a joke. They get nothing resolved. Then they have the NERVE to write a bad review on my daughter's account because check out was at 11:30am and we left at 1:30pm. They want to charge her $300.00 for leaving 2 hours later. I think my daughter should be compensated for not having a pool for the kids an entire weekend. You know what that is having kids stare at the pool wanting to get in and they can't? Shameful. They correct and moral thing to do would be to either compensate my daughter for not having the pool for the weekend or dismiss the 2 hour check out and delete the improper review left on her account. PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL USING THIS AIRBNB. DO YOU DUE DELIGENCE AND READ EVERYTHING. AND IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, DO NOT EXPECT TO BE FULLY HELPED."

Eventually after about a week I got a refund a booked somewhere else as I felt uncomfortable going to the original booking after what had happened.

To top it off, when my brother who is an Airbnb user also tried to rebook the rental, he was denied because he did not have any reviews yet, even though he has used Airbnb in the past.  I am appalled at the way you treat your new users as well as past users. I had this reservation for exactly  4 months and you cancelled it just over a month before the trip!  UNACCEPTABLE!!!!

I talked to a Fernando and a Maria and one other I forget their name with absolutely zero help. This company needs to be shut down. I would give negative stars if I could. NEVER, I REPEAT, NEVER use this company. I will keep shouting until the world freezes over. There are far better companies out there that actually look after their customers. Not feed them a bunch of bs. Make lies about calling you back multiple times and then never do and then make you wait 40 minutes multiple times to get through to someone that won't even help you. My best advise is to spend you money elsewhere with a company that values their customer."

Poor customer service.,Our company has spent A LOT of money with Airbnb over the past few years.  One host made false accusations against our company and Airbnb shut down our account without even allowing us the chance to resolve the issue.  We have closed all of our accounts with Airbnb at this time.

I booked accommodation for a work event with work colleagues (we work in emergency services). Due to the covid 19 pandemic the event was cancelled and we were then allotted to our respective teams across London to do what we do on the front line. We lost the entirety of the amount we paid (approx £650) and received only the £100 cleaning fee. The host refused to give any more back and Airbnb simply washed their hands of our request to at least receive some of the money back, stating it’s up to the discretion of the host. Do not use Airbnb. They do not care."

Don’t use itI had this app more than 3 years and my review was always 5 stars. Last time I booked a place to stay when I was there to check in the host took my Id card and took a picture which is against the rules. Anyway the host denied to explain him self and wanted me to leave. I reported the incident to Airbnb. They thought the same that was against rules. Later I got call from an investigator from Airbnb to investigate and get more details. After that they took a decision that they will remove my account thus they were on my side. They keep the host because he has many apartments on their app :).

I book 4 different places on West Coast of Ireland over 10 nights. 1st went very well, but the second and third were pretty bad. I rang customer service about the 2nd stay, which advertised smoke alarms, monoxide alarm and WiFi throughout accommodation. None of this was the case. The cooker oven couldn't be used because it was filthy and smoke coming out. Host took two days to clean it, by which time we where leaving anyway. Customer service would not find alternative accommodation and would not compensate us for this, not even a discount. Its left a lasting scar. It seems there is no restrictions on host that are reported and no come back for us. Consumers when something goes wrong. I use booking.com which has better cover and support, from experience, for the customers."

Checked 3 again weeks before the holiday and guess what? The owners had sold the property! Got a full refund but then stress as only 3 weeks until we go...had a look for a great place booked it. Guess what? 24hrs after booking the owner cancelled...Why? Becuase they advertised it as £85 a night and they turned round and said Airbnb made a mistake as it should have been £1,275 a NIGHT! But as a guesture they'd reduce it to £400 a night.... I don't think so! At this stage I thought ..why bother booking with Airbnb...you are not guarenteed any booking at any price....why take the risk with your holidays. A friend had a similar incident...Far too common with Airbnb.. No wonder 79% of reviewers say they are bad!!! AVOID!!"

In other words the door was shut in my face.2. As there was no assistance/solution, I had to call again.3. Spoke to Justine C who apologized for the inconvenience, assured me of her help, took 20 minutes to investigate after which she sent me a message saying that “It looks like you already wrote to us about this issue, so we've combined this message with your other message” and closed the thread instantly, with no opportunity for me to advise that her statement is not true and that the issue has never been raised before. In other words the door was shut in my face.4. As there was no assistance/solution, I had to call again.5. Spoke to Tamilla, but it sounded like she is in a club, with so much noise in the background that I cannot hear what she says. I informed her about this and that I need to hang up and call again.6. As there was no assistance/solution, I had to call again.7. Spoke to a lady but cannot remember her name. I didn’t complain to her but said that I have a complaint about the AirBnB specialists that needs to be resolved, and I would like to speak to her manager. I was informed that he was busy, and if I can wait an hour or so. I said no, I want to talk to someone now, I am already sitting here for hours, and it is in the middle of the night, and I am tired. I have then suggested that this supervisor can send me an email to my given email address.8. The next day (today), I did not get an email from supervisor Red, which makes it clear to me that they are not at all interested in a conversation with me. Instead, I got a message via AirBnB inbox. Together with another apology, I was informed that I should get a letter from my lawyer or court, and then send it to them. 9. Just to confirm no interest in my case, and no escalation, Red further informed me that he will not be available today, neither tomorrow, nor if I need further assistance, then I can reach out to the help center.10. This leads me back to the start, with all my time wasted.11. Again the case was close instantly, without giving me an opportunity to respond.12. I have called again and spoke to Russel who was not able to provide me with contact details of is supervisor/manager. Although he wanted to help, I have mentioned to him that it would be unethical to complaint to him about his superiors, so I need to speak to his superior. After another 30min hold, he was still not able to get hold of his supervisor but suggested again that the supervisor will call me back - a fable that I am already familiar with after being with AirBnB for only 2 days. Needless to say, the supervisor never called back.13.	Conclusion: AirBnB are quick to take their cut for a booking, but not there for their hosts for anything more than a “specialist” who can only provide basic help with bookings, and you were never be able to make contact with a superior of any kind, because they don’t give out any contact details, not to their hosts, neither to their customers, neither to their own specialists.As a host, I would have also give them a zero star, if only there was one. They should consider the 1 star as a bonus!"

Then I disputed with AIRBNB. However AIRBNB claims all is fine as host states you have to use host's booking flow. There is nowhere information what host rules are nor any link. If you have entered contract with AIRBNB and host's rules are not disclosed AIRBNB is fine with this and you will lose your money. I have lost $200. Host have never replied to my cancelation nor AIRBNB recognised there is no way to see host rules before entering rental agreement.I learned that it is common practise by AIRBNB to facilitating this kind of fraud.

So what started for me, as trying to help airbnb with a company that broke the rules of money under the table turned into us getting scammed. and while I was explaining this to what seemed like a manager. he just hang up the phone.

She chose not to understand my request to reschedule, instead emailing on the intended date of arrival to clarify the position, then went ahead and charged the full amount.

We found this great looking place that was a little out of our way but the place sounded perfect for what we were looking for. Upon trying to book they had to verify my friends identity (which inexplicably was going to take 3 to 4 hours) but they said the room would be reserved. So we started on our way. Some time went by and my friend called again to make sure we were not driving out for no reason. Again they verified that the reservation would be there. We get here and the reservation is nowhere to be found. We call them again and they say he was supposed to provide an id (which no service agent said anything about) and that it was now too late to book the place. When we asked to speak to a supervisor they said it would take 24 hrs demonstrating there is little to no oversight and they provide no ability to provide customer service for the guest and the host, WHICH IS THEIR FREAKIN JOB!! Now we are stranded in a small town with nowhere to stay so we have to drive around hoping to find something.

I was the victim of an insurance scam by the owner and was charged $3,900 by Airbnb, and when I tried to contest it, the only response I got was that Airbnb suspended my account for ""violating their community guidelines""!  Outrageously unjust treatment.  The details: I rented a basement apartment for a month in Marietta GA, and while I was away for a week, the owners said the basement flooded due to their sump pump backing up.  She then insinuated that I was at fault because I supposedly ""left the washing machine on"". I pointed out that even if I had (which I hadn't) a washing machine stops when the cycle is done.  So they changed the accusation and said I left the faucet on.  I had done a walk around before leaving for the week, so I know I hadn't, but I pointed out that even if a faucet was on, it would just run down the drain. So, without any further communication, they submitted an insurance claim to Airbnb and reported that I had flushed all kinds of debris down the toilet and made the sump pump back up.   When I saw this new accusation, which of course was entirely false and just an attempt to blame me, the guest, so they could get Airbnb insurance money, I wrote to them asking them to retract that because we both knew it was untrue.  They texted back, ""Don't worry, it won't affect you, we're not saying you are a bad renter -- we just have to report it this way."" I then received a $3,900 bill from Airbnb.  So I reported this to Airbnb and said that this was insurance fraud. Airbnb's reponse was to ban me from their site.  I will never, ever use Airbnb again even if I get re-instated, and I hope you don't become a victim of this fraud like I did!"

I understand that this only applies if we cancel the booking but not amending the booking.  On AIRBNB booking platform there is the option to request an amendment of the dates. 8. I asked Airbnb to speak to Manager and explain to them that There is nothing in the terms of Condition saying that we can not amend the booking. There is an option in the        platform where you can ask to amend dates.Airbnb is under breach of contract. Airbnb has released the money to the Agency which has not provided the accomodation after the case has been flagged 10 days before the check in.  Algarve Vacation has broken the contract and has taken money from guests for UNUSED SERVICE with notice given to them 10 days before check in.I have take to my credit card and I am hopping we can get the money back.Please avoid booking with Airbnb."

There customer service is the worst that I have ever encountered, I could not speak to anyone and they just kept sending the same automated message. They refused to give me the hosts contact details or pass mine to him. Eventually I managed to contact the host who confirmed that Airbnb had cancelled our stay and not him due to a complaint by a previous guest about the accommodation which has been sorted out.I would recommend that no one books through Airbnb as they will ruin your holiday plans."
924,Kelly Hejtmancik,US,1 review,"Thursday, June 17, 2021, 01:25:04 PM",1,AirBNB Host Guarantee false.  Beware!!!,"AirBNB denied paying a substantiated claim of property damage of a little over $3500.00 from one of their guests staying in our duplex suite.  The rules were no smoking, no pets and no more than 6 guests.  These guests destroyed our duplex.  They punched and broke glass of entry door.  Smoked, had 3 dogs which one bled being in heat, as well as stole and damaged furniture.  A neighbor told us they had over 15 people in the rental.  AirBNB claims they have a host guarantee for property damage.  We filed a police report, took pictures of all the damages, got invoices, quotes, receipts of things that either needed to be cleaned or damaged that needed to be replaced.  We submitted to AirBNB all valid proof and they closed the case out with a $279 reimbursement and stated they mediated this.  This is unacceptable because we are well over that amount and have already paid out $2500 to fix these damages.  I am filing a complaint due to AirBNB not screening their guests as well as false advertisement of their host guarantee. We are super host and this is how AirBNB takes care of us.  Beware and stay away from this company!!"

You are never going to satisfy Host's requirements, their check-out procedures and so on. Instead of enjoying your vacation, you need to start worrying about the smallest detail on how the leave the house back to the exact way it was presented. You will be stressing out that rather than enjoying your vacation to the last second. Is the chair in place, is the kitchen neat, is everything back to normal. Is it? Is it? Is it really? Sometimes you will be slapped with huge cleaning fee. No surprise there. I am fine with following rules but I don't like getting judged at the end of the stay on how messy some things were because my kind of fine is not your kind of fine. Definitely not doing it again."

Justin, please steer clear of this man he manages 5 properties in this area and I believe has fake reviews posted also. The apartment was filthy I realised as soon as I opened the door, there was a lot of damage from an illegal party that had been held there before I arrived, vomit on the balcony red wine stains on carpet, I could go on and on and have video and photographic evidence to back this up, rang the host he arrived to say it looks better than it was before you arrived!!! Promised if I stayed first night he would refund me for this and have cleaners and painters to come in the following day, then denied the next day he ever said this to me. I spent my whole trip ringing, messaging and sending evidence to Airbnb, and then the host decided he would accuse me of the damages and charge me disgusting, slanderous man. Airbnb refunded the cleaning fee and told me they would take a loss for first night and refund this, as I said I had irrefutable evidence of the damage when I arrived, I emailed Brian Chesky CEO of Airbnb no reply and mow read in the news today Airbnb are constantly covering up horror stories and deleting bad reviews surprise! I managed private apartments for a superhost for 5 years and had genuine 5 star reviews from satisfied guests, these so called hosts that treat guests in this horrendous way should not be allowed on a platform were they can abuse honest travellers who book in good faith. I feel many more people will come forward now their stories to prove their bad experiences, and this could now be the end of Airbnb, I have had many great experiences in Airbnb properties but will never use them again, as I'm disgusted by the lack of support I received."

Other than these 2 I have had no difficulties. In the first case, in Austin, the unit was filthy, the bed slept in (many times, month-old used sheets). There were piles of wet towels on the floor and fresh human waste on the toilet seat. Two electrical switches did not work. There was no room key. The refrigerator was disgusting; it stank and had spills inside. I went to a hotel. I don't care much about the money itself (only $54) but the ripoff concept really gets to me. I want this host stopped from damaging others as he did me. From Airbnb I got nothing. No refund, no assurance that this host's listing is being inspected or reviewed. Unreadable email from a bot counts as nothing.In the second incident, in Spokane, the host sent me no directions for entry until 9pm (check in is at 2pm), and by 9pm I had gone to a hotel. The host did not answer my email or phone call. How else was I to reach her? I am sitting alone outside the gate. Darkness is coming. Yet the host says I should have communicated more (how?) and refuses to refund my money. What makes it worse is she also charged me for 2 horseback rides (I told her twice it was a ride for one) which we did not show up for because we were not there. We were at the hotel we winded up staying at). The host refuses to refund this amount also. I have not filed my complaint yet because my hands start shaking with rage whenever I try to type this story. But I have to admit after the Austin experience, I have little confidence that Airbnb will make it right"

It was very late when we arrived because it was my son 5th birthday and we had celebrated in the city and was tired when we arrived. The next day we had a funeral to attend so I didn’t get around to calling about the lock. The funeral was very hard for us so I did not address the lock the next day. There was signs that stated to not answer the door or use the front door all around the apartment. While sleeping The US Marshall started bagging on the door scared the living hell out of me and my kids. I have stage 4 cancer and really needed my rest, but they said that we had to go even after me trying to show that I had paid $750 for me and my kids to stay until the 8th of June. We did not have anywhere to go and I didn’t have any extra money to pay for another place to stay. Me and my kids got what we could and sat on the steps while crying and in disbelief. I had grocery’s and clothes and other personal belongings that we was not able to get because the officers would let us and stated that they was seizing everything. I do not live in Atlanta to go to court to get my belonging. What kind of checks are Airbnb doing on these people that they are approving for family’s to stay with.

I have to go to London for a training course which I have prepaid for and so I immediately went onto the Airbnb site, found a suitable apartment and requested to stay. My request was declined within 24hrs and the host sent me a message saying she could not accommodate me for the dates requested HOWEVER Airbnb took £970.30 out of my account regardless. They stole £970.30. After contacting customer support who refused/would not answer my questions as to WHY (they danced around my questions) I went to their Facebook page and read some of the reviews which lead me to Trust Pilot. I wasn't surprised to read so many negative reviews. After 5 days of pending my £970.30 was finally put back into my account with no follow through communication of apology, no offer of a discount, absolutely nothing. I have deleted my account as I do not trust them and feel extremely fortunate to have my hard earned money back in my account. I've now booked through a different company which so far has been hassle free with great communication. A scary lesson learnt, Airbnb is now a broken system post the Covid 19 pandemic."

Judging from the reviews customer support should be called customer wish we could help you, but screw you.  What happened is when we booked there were plenty of options in our price range, after about 6 weeks of us paying in full the host canceled our reservation. The cheapest place for us to rent was more than double the reservation that was canceled.  I thought that Airbnb should have at least covered some of the more expensive condo, but they wouldn't chip in a dime.  I will never use Airbnb again. THEY SUCK."

Also it's very unclear on the cancelation policy. My husband read it and thought the same thing I did. I am not expecting a full refund...but something more than $52! Very immoral and not very good in customer service. I have tried to be very nice but this irritates me to no end. I understand a service fee....so be sure to read the policy very thoroughly.

As a long-term host, the ineptitude and tone deafness toward hosts are, well, deafening.  Airbnb started off as a company brokering in, primarily, illegal rentals.It should come as no surprise that the company constantly talking about community, while they are destroying neighborhoods, is so ambivalent to their hosts.  Airbnb goes out of their way to ensure hosts know how little Airbnb respects them and their properties.Murders, rapes, mass shootings, etc. have had very little impact on their business model.  We have had to contact police on multiple occasions and do not receive calls from Airbnb until days later.  Once you get over the trauma of their house-trashing demographic, you get to move on to their ""resolution specialist"".'Specialist',  is apparently a word that applies to everyone in an overseas call center.  They ignore laws governing contracts and love to tell you Airbnb has the final say.  They literally ignore their terms of service, host house rules and make up valuations for damages (usually pennies on the dollar). In my experience, any profit was lost in the amount of babysitting and time spent filing resolution claims, BEWARE."

The photos on Airbnb showed a fence surrounding the garden so we booked. On arrival we found that the fence had been removed about two months before and replaced with shrubs with gaps in between and direct access into a busy main road. We had not been told about this in advance as we would have cancelled. We failed to comply with Airbnb terms for complaints as it was our very first stay booked through them. The host refused a partial refund for our ruined stay and so did Airbnb. Needless to say we shall not be using them again.
971,Myra Bronstein,US,10 reviews,"Wednesday, June 2, 2021, 04:52:50 AM",1,A bunch of crooks,"Stayed at an airbnb in Queretaro city, Mexico where the host, Leandro, refused a refund on an apartment that did not have electricity. The lack of electricity forced me to find other housing on an emergency basis. I called airbnb support for help the day of the (all day) electrical outage, and they canceled the reservation with one day remaining. In spite of promising a refund during the call they never sent it. Of course, that was the whole point of the call. Now after 2 weeks of escalating the issue up the airbnb support chain the latest agent said to deal with the host (Leandro) for a refund. The same host (Leandro) that refused a refund 2 weeks ago. Just a complete runaround. Not surprisingly the host (Leandro) again refused a refund today.Clearly the host is a thief and airbnb is an accomplice.So if you stay in an airbnb with a problem (like lack of electricity, lack of water, total structural collapse, fire, etc) that forces you to move, and you have an unethical host as I did (Leandro), they will keep your money even though the unit is uninhabitable. Airbnb will not help. Can you imagine a hotel, or any other business, operating like this?It's out and out fraud and theft. This is what I learned from my latest, and final, airbnb stay.The host (Leandro) and airbnb are a bunch of crooks."

Leaving it impossible for me to stick to the cancellation policies. They have made no real effort to get my money back and have now closed the case finalising that they owe me no refund and that they are sticking to their “policy” I am disgusted that they are willing to withhold £800 that hadn’t even left my account when I decided to cancel.

Turned up at the accommodation after a 4 hour drive to be told the business no longer exists and Airbnb should have taken the advert down. The host turned us away and so we rung Airbnb and spoke to a rep and explained the situation. The rep apologised and offered a refund which will take 15 working days to be banked and offered no alternatives at a similar price or helped with arranging another place for us to stay even after explain that we drove 4 hours to get here and that we were 7 months pregnany. We had to drive 4 hours back. Absolutely disappointed In The company. They took no responsibility in correcting their mistake.

Airbnb offered me little to no assistance in finding a new room. They took hours to get to the problem, while I had no where to go in NYC. They offered me a minor discount after rates had doubled and selection was slim to none. There was nothing left in my price range, and a hotel turned out cheaper. At least I know that with a hotel my room is guaranteed. Despite the paltry coupon incentives they threw at me, I’ll be using homeaway.com and hotels going forward instead of Airbnb. Airbnb has terrible support, and took no initiative to rectify this bad situation. I had to call them three times to decipher what was happening. Airbnb may as well be bait and switch since they essentially tried to upsell me after the cancelation. I’ll be reporting this to BBB as well."

Otherwise they will trash you in a review. They can also forget about giving  you important informations about wifi etc.  You are a paying customer but you will be treated like a person who is being made a favour   as if you were staying there for free.

After years of booking through agents of allKinds, my last experience has prompted me write my first bad rental review. My daughter is autistic and I am her carer, and I book all her holidays or breaks. She doesn’t show much emotion and the Airbnb host really made her feel bad on her birthday, and daughter felt he was racist. The host constant trespassed on the property, and used a spy door bell to monitor if people were in garden past 21:00, which he deemed a rule. Even if it was lockdown ... which it was not, the rule was draconian. Along with other draconian rules, this host was allowed to take money with no Airbnb operative available to navigate any conflict. Since then, no Airbnb contact has been made as the message is still pending a reply..... The one operative couldn’t answer any questions and told me a specialist team will call .... it’s been 3 days and nothing. So if I can advise anything. I’d advise booking.com. As I have never had and issues with customer service or help during a stay, or even a discriminative host being an issues.Bristol is a great city, but keynsham rentals with jacuzzi is one to stay away from. I look forward to the day Airbnb closes and the terrible hosts stop earning easy money by giving bad services. Reviews are terrible for this service. Trust pilot should act on our behalf and act now.

I recently reported an issue to Airbnb that a host was communicating with me with sincere hostility and overall refused to address the fact that she left her home a disgusting mess before we stayed. Airbnb‘s response was that I did not report an issue to them within 24 hours. However I was traveling with limited cell service, and didn’t think I needed to escalate an issue at that time. I thought I would be able to talk to the host but she turned out to be incredibly rude and ignored all of the legitimate issues regarding her house. I reported this issue to Airbnb to alert them that someone like this should not be able to continue using the platform. This completely goes against the traditional environment Airbnb has had and should have. They let me know they’re not going to do anything further or even look into my conversations with this host and are deciding to continue working with her which I think that is a huge mistake. Additionally, AirBnb has become way more expensive without any amenities traditional hotels offer, and when bad experiences like this happen, they just choose to ignore it. I have had great hosts before but they do not make up for the way AirBnb refuses to consider legitimate concerns from its customers. Shame."

I booked a place that reportedly was a duplex with the owner, Gerda, living on one side.  The place appeared dated but it reported was water front.  I booked it and received the address.  A reverse address showed the house was for sale, being sold “as is” and currently under contract.  I took it a step further and contacted realtors in the area. Both indicated that this property was for sale and the sale had not gone through.  They also provided me with the reported realtor of the property although he never got back to me.  Furthermore, they confirmed that the listing was for the address as well as the “unit 1” which was reportedly the rental unit.  I called Airbnb.  After a reported “investigation” they told me the property was legitimate.  They said the pictures in the listing did not match the ones in the for sale, because the one for sale had siding and that the rental address had a unit #1 (they could careless that the realtors said the sale listing included unit 1)...And THE BEST PART.  Their investigation consisted of calling the person with the listing to confirm the listing.  Yes, you read that right!  THE PROOF OF A REAL LISTING WAS TO CALL THE PERSON RUNNING THE SCAM AND ASK IF THEY WERE RUNNING A SCAM!  Here’s the thing the pictures could have easily come from the listing when the house sold previously, either that or there is the exact same structure with the exact same “beach” sign and the exact same bushes and the exact same address for sale.  (Inset head slap). For me, I just took advantage of the 48 hour cancellation policy and canceled this booking!  However, in this process I learned that this company has the worst refund/assistance policy when it comes to being scammed.  Their customer service is lacking at best.   I will ALWAYS stick with other companies in the future."

The restriction remained and thus I requested to change my dates to June.  The host confirmed I could have this date but could not figure out how to accept that on her end so I was told to contact Airbnb, which I did. Airbnd then needed to contact her to help her do this. By the time they did this the she has accepted someone else for the June dates. With all other dates booked, I reluctantly booked May dates she offered…explicitly stating that this is dependent on the government restrictions allowing the intercounty travel by then.   We got the notification on May 1st  that the restrictions had not been lifted so I immediately contacted the host to request we move the dates out to September due to the government restrictions not allowing us to travel outside county. She refused to accept the change stating that due to Covid she had many cancellations and is now she is refusing to accept any changes.  I pleaded with her to allow for this change.  This cost was over €1,100 that I had saved for months to be able to have a mini trip away with my daughter.   We have not been able to travel to see our family in over a year and had loss of my Father in this timeframe.  To take this money from me, she took our only option for a small and much needed holiday this summer.   I find it horrible treatment to a customer to refuse to change dates of visit when it is literally the country restricting travel and this was discussed with her up front.   She knows that the country is restricting travel. She pushed me to the May dates due to her error and apologised to me for it.  I communicated to her that May would have to be dependent on the Country travel restrictions.  She simply took it as an opportunity to take my €1,100 paid fee (which she increased by 350+) for the May dates vs. April dates knowingly in  our ability to travel was risk due to the restrictions.    This is by far the worst treatment I can honestly say I have experienced.  And when I filed a formal complaint with Airbnb they simply did not care at all and would only state that it was up to host and the cancellation policy allowed her to not refund or change the dates.   I asked how I could file a complaint to them about the treatment I received from their host so it was on their file, and they told me they don’t take complaints against hosts, only review for refunds."

I was informed that because my stay had ended they weren't going to do anything,  even notify they host.If I were the host I would want to be informed. Makes me question how many issues and complaints airbnb sweeps under the rug...I do not blame the host in the least bit, these things happen.. but for airbnb to approach an issue in this manner..Inexcusable.

Not even a sorry from this host. From Airbnb I get a message stating they know its inconvenient so ill be refunded within 5 days (As if refund was some kind of compensation). I wasn't able to leave a review on the host's page and when I called airbnb they said I could only leave a review at places I stayed at. Now nothing is available by the beach and I've planned my work schedule and kid's summer camp around this. Airbnb did nothing at all for me.

The app also frequently has glitches when trying to ammend the date of travel and customer support always has to find weird work arounds (like having to log on the website to make a payment). Considering this is a multi-BILLION dollar app you would think they would have this taken care of by now. They also will happily refund the host fee if there is a problem but will not give their fee back. If airbnb was not a monopoly I would not use their service.

Well, my experience was less than pleasant. First, on arriving at the airport, my host had not sent my keypad information for check in, so after reaching out to them, I waited 45 minutes at the airport. They finally called and gave me the code. On arriving at the destination, the code did not work. I then reached out to them again letting them know. It started to rain and I was stuck outside for 25 minutes just hoping they'd respond soon. The host drove by smoking a cigarette and said, oh, I didn't know you were staying here. They then sat in the car for another 3 minutes with their windows rolled up all while I stood outside in the rain with no shelter. They then said sorry we gave you the wrong code. Upon entering after finally checking in, I did a walk through in the place. Now the place looked exactly like the pictures. The issue? There were roaches and 2 other types of bugs all inside. Roaches, stains, and holes in the bed, roaches in the bathroom and a dirty shower curtain. All of the dishes and silverware were covered with old hard food. The kitchen sink was clogged on both sides. The patio door also did not open. I chose not to sleep in the bed given the circumstances, so I slept on the couch. 5 nights of the most uncomfortable sleeping I've ever had. I decided to continue my stay without contacting the host again because I didn't want to be put in a situation of me looking for another Airbnb or a hotel at the last minute, also, I didn't feel comfortable requesting a refund while I'm staying in the place I want a refund for. After I had checked out, I let the host know I did. I didn't get a response at all. Not how my stay was, if I enjoyed myself or anything. I then decided to request a refund. I initially paid $422 and I requested just $100. The host never replied, after 4 days of waiting, I decided to escalate the situation by contacting airbnb's support help. I did, it took them 3 days to respond and they told me they have no control over refunds and it's left to the host to issue a refund if they want and also they issue how much they want. No help to me at all. This has ruined all future endeavors of me using Airbnb. Also, I won't give any names, but the place I stayed was in Denver Colorado. I hope this helps others of deciding whether or not to use Airbnb."

However, when I arrive in the apartment, there is no one there and I have been waiting, calling, messaging to the Host's contact and just keep saying they are working out. There is no sense for my and my 7year old daughter waiting at 2 am without hopes. We have to find other immediate hotel for staying that night and find alternative accommodation on the next day. I also suffer lost due to the need to re-ordering the COVID test pack and cost me GBP420 for this!! This is all because of the host's failure.

I checked in at 3:30 and left the next day. I left a positive review for the host and they was allowed to see the review left for me. She stated I never told her about the dog and that I checked in prior to her 4:00 check in time. I showed her the note from the initial booking about my dog as well as the email from airbnb about check in. She didn't care so I approached airbnb about the review supplying screenshots of the booking info and check in email. Airbnb also didn't care and said that they ""can't do anything if a host lies in their review"". WHAT!?!?!? So you can lie all you want and you have zero recourse.

March came, I emailed him... no reply. April came, I emailed him...no reply. Now May is here and Spain is on the amber list so travel for leisure is not permitted. I once again emailed the host to ask to push the booking to next year and finally he replied essentially saying it wasn't his problem, no he wouldn't push the booking forward (despite saying earlier in the year he would) and I'd have to cancel which means I lose 50% plus a £900 airbnb service fee. Airbnb said they can't help me.... lovely to see that they have no issue with having lying and non responding hosts on their platform. Covid is a horrible situation for everyone, but there should be some kind of protection for the consumer - the host isn't an individual, they're a company and so will be insured against losses. No kind of compromise was offered and airbnb just went ""oh well"". And sorry, but a £900 service fee is ridiculous for essentially doing nothing! Suffice to say I won't ever be using Airbnb again."

I only stated the positive things in the public review.But the host lost her mind.  I was receiving huge long meaaages over and over.  I had to contact Air B&B to block her.But now today I woke up to a message from Air B&B on behalf of the host because she couldn’t get ahold of me.  I can’t believe they are helping her continue to harass me."

I've had to initiate legal proceedings against the host and Airbnb was totally unwilling to do anything WHATSOEVER to help me. They wouldn't even contact the host and ask why they hadn't delivered on their promise to mail my things to me. It was nearly impossible to even get into contact with a customer service rep at all really. I can't believe how unwilling they are to do anything at all to help me. Years i've used their service, i'm even a shareholder. Well i've sold my shares and i'll spend a nice long while making sure anyone who asks uses VRBO or something else instead.

I lost a lot of money in Australia last year as I had little choice but to return back to the UK ( during the lockdown) and was not able to get a full refund on my accommodation as it was booked after the lockdown date. My return flight was cancelled and I had to find somewhere to stay and managed to get an aerbnb but then got another flight. In compensation I was offered a voucher for £145 which was up to the end of April this year but because of currents restrictions have been unable to use it. Even my voucher from Emirates , my original flight had a two year period.Aerbnb  are not prepared to extend the voucher. I know this amount is small compared to others who have lost bookings to them. That is why I’m highlighting it. Their  hosts would have been able to get grants etc from the government for loss of earnings. Guests haven’t been able to get nothing if their voucher is still within restriction timescale.They are a disgrace."

1056,Nilay,US,1 review,"Wednesday, May 5, 2021, 11:28:15 PM",1,Peaceful Casita in the Heart of West Sedona,"Reading the reviews here everything makes sense. I stayed in “Peaceful Casita in the Heart of West Sedona hosted by Sara and Lori.” The place was poorly maintained, ac dripping water, which when informed to the host was considered “not a big deal”, ceiling fan not working, broken bathroom taps and clogged tub drain, minimal amenities not working. When we complained about this to airbnb WITH PROOF we were offered a refund but what followed was complete harassment. As soon as Lori got to know that we have complained about their property to airbnb, she left me a review stating I was “rude and messy”, the only conversation I had with Sara was to request to fix the ac due to the scorching heat in Sedona’s weather, and I was advised to “open the ac and clean the filter” and I refused. After that all my interactions were with airbnb customer service. We had paid over a 100$ for cleaning fee yet we cleaned the place before leaving. When I told airbnb about the fabricated review I was advised to give a public reply and so I did and asked for proofs of my rudeness and messiness.In reply to my review for the property, I was called a “scammer” for refund! I am a physician serving the community, the refund that they provided was just a token of compensation for the poorly maintained property I paid for, the amount has not made me any richer.I called airbnb customer service again and told them that I do not care for the refund and that strict action has to be taken against these hosts who think fabricating stuff on a public platform against their customers who wrote a negative review for them, is ok.In reply airbnb in their own words basically told me that my harassment was just a response and that before writing the review I should have thought of the repercussions of the words I used as the hosts are allowed to reply in whichever way they want. They told me its not the first time a host has acted like this in response to a negative review BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THEIR POLICY TO RECTIFY IT! “Customer service”, not so much customer oriented I must say!"

Carole  Stephen-Smith of Palm Desert will go to great lengths to make sure your negative review never sees the light of day. I left my stay early due to the pool being frigid and unheated. I mistakenly assumed since the pool was the front featured amenity, it would be heated.. I fully accept that mistake. My previous experiences with pools, hosts have specified if the pool wasn’t heated and would offer to do so with an extra charge. When I asked Carole about the pool however, she launched into a rant about how it was too expensive to heat her pool, offered no solution, and if I wanted to swim I should go to the civic center or the Marriott. Once Carole learned that my Husband and I checked into a nearby hotel and left early, she acted contrite and said she would like to offer a “small refund.” I told her that would be appreciated. Next, she tells me that her reviews are “very important to her,” and that she would send the refund after we both completed our respective reviews. Believing she was in good faith trying to rectify the situation, I gladly accepted. As it turned out, Carole’s plan was to trick me into giving a positive review and once they were completed, she abandoned the refund. Reviews are permanent and cannot be revised. Therefore, I had to contact Airbnb to have my review removed and report the issue.If you take a minute to scroll through and find the few people who gave Carole a bad review, you’ll see that she responds in a rage, seemingly losing her ability to proofread and use correct grammar. My only intention with this response is to make people aware of the kind of person they’ll be dealing with, because I’m sure she has done the same thing to others in the past and wouldn’t hesitate to do it again in the future.

The main room was the most filthy. They made us wait 3 hours because they said it wasn’t clean yet only to come in to a nasty situation. It was my 30th birthday and I was so disappointed. We spent most of our time out of the room because it was not comfortable or worth $1000 spent. This was a horrible experience. Very disappointing. Still have not received a response back for refund.

Three of us smelled mold and a horrible floral cleaning solution, both of which I’m allergic to. In addition, it was advertised as rustic and private but it was an apartment on the side of a dilapidated mission center/church in an unsafe part of the city with homeless people in the parking lot. Most of the reviews were very good, which is baffling. Maybe they are used to staying in hostels. Some of his other properties have bad reviews with similar issues. I will never use Airbnb again."

I got ahold of a human being on their support line just to be told I need to contact AirBnB through e-mail. I asked the man for the e-mail and he said he couldn’t provide it and that they would reach out to me most likely in 48 hours. My trip was all planned and is in a few days.

We selected airbnb because they advertise it is a requirement yet there are no checks and balances to make sure customers are not placed at risk by host. When I say the home was filthy, I mean filth!What is Airbnb’s 5-step enhanced cleaning process?The 5-step cleaning process is a set of cleaning practices that all hosts are required to follow between guest stays, in addition to their local laws and guidelines.

My friend and I rented a property for a 3 month travel assignment from a host (14911 Cardiff Cliff Lane Houston Texas) the host was very rude, nasty, unwelcoming and spiteful! I was at this house for 4 days with no running refrigerator. I lost all my groceries because of that. The house was hot like hell. The host controlled the A/C until via his phone. The co-host which was his his girlfriend kept showing up to the house unannounced. He has cameras outside the house and he watches everything that you do like a hawk. Anything we did was an issue. We would do something he didn’t like it then he would then try to turn it into a rule. For example I had family visiting from Florida. They were not staying with me. They had their own Airbnb. They dropped me off to pick up some clothes so that I could spend the weekend with them and he tried to charge me $100 for them stopping by the house. We were there for less then 25 minutes. After I got me things 2 days later he created a new rule that stated no visitors on the property at any time violation will be $25 each person. How could I break a rule before it was even a rule? I refused to pay and he told Airbnb that he wanted us out that same night. Airbnb gave us until the next day at 11 am to be out. That same night the host sent a strange man to the property without giving us notice that someone was coming. This man followed us around the house. We were 2 women in a state that we are not from. We didn’t know if this man was a rapist, a theft or a murder. We were scared! We did not know this man from anywhere. We called the police several times. The host also had some women come to the property and she verbally and physically attacked me!!!! After 2 hours police finally arrived. I pressed charges. Airbnb did nothing to fix the situation. This guy is still on there platform renting out his home and he had the nerve to write a bad review on me and lied stating that I broke several rules. Airbnb took down both my friend and my review of his property staying it was not relevant. But left his false review of us up. Airbnb can see that the rules were made after we booked with the host and even told us that we did not have to abide by those rules because they were created after the fact. So why would they allow this man to write false statements about us. They don’t want people to know how they were negligent, and how unsafe this whole situation was. I ended up hurt had to go to the urgent care and was assaulted on one of their properties and they deemed that not relevant. I would never recommend anyone to stay there."

The governor of the state instituted a lock down order so I reached out to the host to cancel. I was acting in good faith and she persuaded me not to cancel, but rather to try to wait it out and see if another weekend in the future worked out. I had already paid nearly $3,000 for the week. Eventually, when the scope of the pandemic became clear, I wanted to cancel but was unable to. AirBNB kept the money even though no services had been provided because of some small print they couldn't even point to in the contract. Went so far as to even file an arbitration claim after being bullied by their repugnant HR staff and their shill attorney. Ultimately the aggravation was not worth it so I've made it a life's mission to cost them more in business then they took from me. This company and its employees are loathsome. Avoid them at all costs. Use VRBO or just book a hotel. You'll be better off."

1071,Milo,CA,1 review,"Sunday, May 2, 2021, 04:33:17 PM",1,"Nightmare on JFK Blvd, Jersey City","I have a serious safety/stay issue that recently happened to me with airbnb.I have rented other stays with Airbnb with great success, until an 8 night stay in Jersey City turned into a nightmare.  Night 5, new guests in unit above us.  At 3am we wondered if they ever sat down.  Someone constantly moving. An older building. No carpet on the floor and you hear every noise.  We spoke to one of the renters in the morning and asked if they could keep the noise down after midnight. She said they were checking that day. But that was not the case.House rules state, NO loud noises between10:00pm to10:00am, no wild parties and no unauthorized visitors.Night 6 – All 3 house rules were broken. A very noisy wild party with at least 10 people.  We hoped they would fizzle out by midnight, but at 1 am we could no longer take it and searched for a hotel and hours later finally got checked in at new hotel. The next morning, I called the Host to lodge a complaint. After several calls by me to her, she did tell me that she contacted airbnb and that it was up to them to kick out the people upstairs.  (I later learned that the host was likely lying to me about contacting airbnb)Night 7 - At 8pm still no word from host about the people being kicked out upstairs and with the noise level starting to increase we had to leave to find another hotel. (We had crucial medical appointments the next morning and the patient, already suffering, needed a good night’s sleep.)Night 8 – Stressed and upset from news from the medical appointments, we returned to the rental knowing that the people upstairs had checked out.Without me asking, the host did issue us a $200 credit which basically covered 1 night’s rental.  But my request to cover my out of pocket and my complaint was ignored by the host.  I was out of pocket $400. The rental cost of the unit was 350 for the 2 nights and sadly airbnb offered me $56 refund.  I did offer to accept a credit for a future stay. The $200 I received plus the $56(not accepted) for a total of $256 does not even cover the cost of 2 nights stay at the airbnb unit, much less my out of pocket and additionally the stress and anxiety caused.Both the host and airbnb ruined that stay. Airbnb effectively punished me for trying to resolve the issue with the host and stay the unit we had already paid for.  Airbnb expected us to contact them and because I waited to hear from the host for an extra 2 days after we checked out, they first denied me any extra compensation and then made it difficult to even get the extra $56 refund.  Horrible.  The safety issue is much more concerning though. Am I supposed to go knock on the door of a party of young people that may be drunk and/or high and ask them to be quiet?  Call the police, call the host at 1am?  None of those options were safe.  Perhaps they would have slashed my tires. Then how would I get to the medical appointments during Covid that had taken months to get, the purpose was to help my friend alleviate chronic pain."

I will try to make this brief and concise. 5 weeks later and about 15 phone calls and countless hours. There is NO protection for unsatisfied guests. I receive generic emails and disrespectful and unfounded accusations from the hosts.. I honored my reservation. It was a treacherous 2 mile drive straight up a  mountain with no guardrails...which was not included anywhere in the description, apparently it was in the rules. .  No one can explain how that is rule, opposed to a description. Not including it in the description is deceitful.  The entire 4 hours we were there the neighbor was doing construction and the noise was so intolerable that my 10 year old begged to leave. The worst part, when I went to use a towel it was stained with brown stuff and had hairs all over it. The host was unresponsive and confrontational. She accused me of all sorts of undocumented claims, that I stained the towels with makeup..funny bc I don't wear makeup. I communicated with her when I was there, no response and when I left....when u go to their site for a refund it automatically cancels the reservation. Hence , u can't write a review, which is also unethical. You charge me , but I can't write or review and I don't even know who charged me. ANY problems contact them immediately, not the host..if u don't get resolution with the host..u lose your opportunity for a refund. We didn't stay either night and they won't give us a dime back saying she could have fixed the towels...but she didn't even try...i WILL NEVER TRUST A COMPANY LIKE THIS EVER AGAIN.another tip ..do not use PayPal,.they won't back u..use a credit card. .its 5 weeks of time and no recourse for the hosts and her disrespectful behavior."

Without them you cannot comply with their demands to  supply personal information to book accommodation. (Downloaded  photos of passport or driving licence then take a photo with your pc or Airbnb ap.) Their help centre is useless. They make it so hard to book  I am now booking elsewhere. What happens to all this personal information Airbnb demand? Is it stored safely? Who has access? Disgruntled employees could use it for their own benefit.

It didn't recognize the phone number and asked for a code sent to the phone. The codes did not work. Then the screen froze with a message that my account was suspended for 24 hours. This was the only reservation in the town/price range so I wanted to secure it immediately. I called customer service for assistance with this issue. Two different operators parroted the same thing - I would have to wait 24 hours and try again. They barely spoke English, they sounded like they were reading from a script and they didn't do a thing, let alone help correct the technical issue in their system. (When I try tomorrow, will I have the same issue and the same runaround?) I then requested to speak with a supervisor and they said it would take 48 hours to do so. The disinterest in new business was apparent. This lack of service is abominable. I was going to list my house with AirBNB but not after this experience. I can only imagine what it would be like as a host or renter with an issue. Their abysmal customer service will allow a competitor to gain an advantage."

They advised me that their decision was final.  When I read the links they sent me none of them applied to me.  They applied to the guest with the weapon.  I was punished for reporting a potential safety threat to the residents and staff of my lodge and the community.

I received a partial refund which is not sufficient considering the issues and stress I experienced. Air BnB say that they cannot help me claim more money back because of their 'policy' which means you must notify them of an issue with the booking within 24 hours of check in.Like most people would, I spent the first 24 hours trying to resolve the issues with the host. When that didn't work, I focused my time on finding alternative accommodation which was extremely difficult and time consuming in current Covid circumstances. I previously trusted Air BnB but now I would go as far as to say that Air BnB is a scam company and as it provides no protection or support for guests.

I note that the # of guests allowed are 16.  So I messaged the host, who did message me back and had no idea why.  So I finally, after 2 days of multiple attempts spoke with a customer rep of Airbnb.  I was stunned to be told that their unbreakable rule, which was not stated anywhere, is that in order for me to book an entire house, my first time using Airbnb, is that I must have 3 positive reviews about me listed on my Airbnb account!  There are NO exceptions allowed!  The host can't do anything because of the contract they signed.  My biggest complaint is that this was never stated to me upon my reservation attempt!!!!  Furthermore Airbnb bombarded me with multiple emails stating 'book now, you have 6 hours left'.  They said I need to book 3 different times with a room or hotel and receive 3 positive reviews in order to book an entire house!

Airbnb tells the host that they keep a deposit for use if there is damage.  In practice, they simply ask the guest to pay for the damages, and if they refuse, airbnb loves to act like a mediator, but they are hardly capable to mediate.  They always resolve in the guests interest because they want the guest to come back.  They are not at all fair.  They also change prices for guests depending on demand and the interest expressed in the home.  They care about themselves first, guests second and the host last.

1111,Asif Itellu,GB,1 review,"Tuesday, April 20, 2021, 10:35:18 PM",1,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. At city apartment ‘Above the roofs of Ulm’,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE... hosts were untrustworthy and left a libellous account of me. I’m unable to respond to their review of me,  so here’s my response to them... Uli and Holger of ‘city apartment above the roofs of Ulm’.Let's start with what was fine. The apartment is large enough for one person and is conveniently located on the edge of Ulm's old town, a few minutes walk from Münsterplatz. The furnishings are modern (IKEA style).  For a few days or a few weeks, one can also come to terms with the small kitchen and the much too small dishwasher here.Now to the very discrediting and false representations by Uli & Holger. The fact that I was 1 hour late to leave after my merry 6 month stay was the case, not hours, it was in fact they who returned after hours having enjoyed the market in Ulm and having a coffee! I waited for them! The craftsmen's visit was announced only days in advance and the craftsmen were granted access without further ado, not weeks and no chance to change the time or date. Unfortunately the craftsmen wore no masks and were only requested by me to put on their masks what should be a matter of course in times of the pandemic. Just to read a meter, the two workmen went into the bedroom for 15 minutes and closed the door behind them. There were several of my valuables. After some time, I wanted to know what the workmen were doing there for so long. I think it's understandable to ask here, when it should be just about reading a meter.The rent for the apartment explicitly includes a final cleaning. With the limited cleaning materials provided, I have already cleaned the apartment regularly in my own interest and handed it over more than broom-clean.In the end, the conflict revolved around the alleged lack of an IKEA bowl and some hangers, for which a replacement was requested. I was accused of theft. Which of these is true? One bowl actually broke, which I reported to Uli and Holger. Another IKEA bowl in the value of max. €2 I should have stolen. Everyone can calculate how probable that is. Regarding the IKEA hangers, I probably confused some of the hangers from the apartment with my own (also from IKEA) and actually did not return all of them. Here it was not due to the will but rather to the fact that I had already been massively insulted and portrayed as a liar and I was not willing to come back again under these circumstances for the ""clothes hanger handover"", especially since I was given an ultimatum at very short notice for this.What Uli and Holger unfortunately did not mention: In several respects, the contractually agreed services were not provided. For example, the WLAN often did not work. During a whole week, the underground parking was not accessible due to maintenance and cleaning work and parking was now still possible on the street (total cost about € 80). The underground parking problem is not the fault of Uli & Holger, but just not my fault either and I would have expected here that one comes to me here cost-wise accommodated, especially considering that Uli & Holger have received more than €11,000 from me over the rental period.In the end, there are usage restrictions (WLAN) and additional costs (parking) for me compared to an IKEA bowl and some hangers (total value about €5) . Everyone can form their own opinion about Uli & Holger here. A good relationship between landlord and tenant is very unlikely under these circumstances with all good will. Therefore, I advise anyone who plans to stay with these landlords for a long time (weeks or months) not to do so. Uli & Holger are only prepared for short visits."

First half gets payed, second half never came out thru some card issues so booking automatically gets cancelled even though it's weeksss before check in (?). Host was an absolute money hungry sucker so only option was to book the same place same dates and pay the full amount if we wanted our first half back otherwise money was gone. Decided alright whatever let's just book it same place same dates so we don't lose the first half as we got promised. Second booking gets payed in full amount and I had to chase them for my refund of the first booking. Went from the host telling me they're looking into the issue to them saying it was not up to them but airbnb. So host was an absolute pain to deal with too. A day before my partner's birthday and the day we were supposed to check in, I get call the night before that a mistake was made from one of them and second booking was cancelled. Is this a really not funny joke at this point now? Money only gets into your account from 5 to 15 days (such a vague answer) and a solution was never given to me apart from having to book again.

But in recent years Airbnb has supported too many dishonest individuals by allowing them to profit by scamming travelers.I complained several times about such situations and even presented some cases to the local police but Airbnb ignored such complaints, and ignored the copies I sent them of the police reports.It is not possible to trust a platform that supports drug addicts, alcoholics, and scammers practicing extortion on travelers. Quite literally, that is what I have experienced. A lot of sociopaths and mentally ill people are using Airbnb to make money, and Airbnb defends them and allows them to continue using the platform.The only case ever in which Airbnb took my side, was when I took a situation in particular that happened in Portugal to the police and then to the courts.Airbnb was afraid this would end in the newspapers and that’s why they were quick to act. However, they never told me exactly what they did with such individuals. They hided their exact procedures precisely because they wanted to use any evidence against me in court.The situation that occurred in Portugal was related to a couple of drug addicts that were always high and had no job apart from renting their house. They were going through my stuff and the stuff of my girlfriend whenever we weren’t at home. I noticed that our credit cards had been touched, and other private items were used as well.When confronted about it, the owner’s response was: “How do you even know I touched your things?” In other words, he was opening the door after I closed it with a key, touching the stuff in the room, checking personal information, and then got aggressive when confronted about his actions.The local police interfered, and the situation went to court. But what did Airbnb do? Most likely suspended their account and hide everything to protect themselves in court. They did their best to hide links and messages.Airbnb took the side of the oppressor, and never disclosed their actions. They saw it as a threat to their brand rather than a situation in which they should take immediate action on side of the traveler paying.That was the only situation among many awful ones experienced in which they acted. But they did so out of fear, rather than a genuine interest in solving the case.The reason why most people don’t face such problems is because the majority in the world are not insane, and not because Airbnb provides a safe experience to travelers. I have also realized that most people decide not to complain, and simply try to forget such events, as if they were isolated cases.They are not. And don’t think these things won’t happen to you or that you are special. The more you use Airbnb, the more likely you are to encounter very unpleasant, and even life threatening situations. Because Airbnb does not care about their travelers. They care only about money. The more apartments and rooms they have, the better for them. They don’t investigate anything and don’t care about what travelers say in regards to their experiences.I then realized something much more perverse about Airbnb:Airbnb constantly DELETES reviews that warn other travelers of the dangers ahead. Airbnb deleted the reviews I posted to such apartments, warning others travelers of what could happen to them.This is why one rents horrible apartments full of positive reviews and wonders what’s wrong with people. Those reviews are not trustworthy. I eventually found that Airbnb constantly monitors reviews, erasing those that warn of dangers that compromise future bookings.Another very vicious thing that Airbnb does, consists of erasing selective parts of the reviews. Meaning that they will delete certain parts and leave others intact, in this way changing the real meaning of what was written. If someone writes positive and negative things, they will erase the negative and leave the positive.In other words, when you rent a room or apartment on Airbnb, you don’t really know if the reviews you are reading are reliable, because Airbnb DELETES ALL REVIEWS that can compromise profitability.Quite a lot of people have complained about this platform, and Airbnb has been doing a very good job in hiding these cases from the general public. But believe me, there are a lot more than what you might think. And as I have read, the other situations described by travelers can be 100x worse than what you are reading here.In a short period of time, and most recently, I had two cases — A Sven from Croatia, and a Karolina, from Poland —, which in both situations tried to extort money from me and succeeded to do so with the help of Airbnb."

They have made it extremely difficult to make changes or cancel reservation. After having searched a lot, the link to make changes did not even work. I had to call the Help centre. They made the change but charged me 12 CAD for it. When I asked, did you charge me for making changes, they said no we did not. I went but I can see a fee on my account. She went no, that is probably part of the room fees!!!! This is the last time I ever book anything on this platform. It leaves you with a feel of some sort of trickery, lack of transparency, confusing you with the structure of their website so that you cannot easily land what you need to do. In a world where internet based services are becoming cheaper and cheaper, Airbnb is very expensive for the services that they really do not provide."

This condo is located in Nashville, Tennessee. This condo is in a very questionable neighborhood with men drinking and loitering right outside the fenced in area of the condo. It literally required 3 different codes to gain entry into the condo. Upon entering the condo, there was a strong odor that both my wife and I immediately noticed. The instructions left at the condo indicated there were five different WIFI networks to choose to connect. Not one of the networks listed ever showed up as a WIFI network through my phone, my wife's phone, or my laptop. After troubleshooting the WIFI issue with no success, I then focused my attention on the tv in the main living area. I was unable to get the tv to work at all. After hearing yelling coming from the outside coupled with cars speeding by consistently I made the decision to leave this condo immediately. I became convinced this condo was not a safe place for my wife and I. I would highly recommend avoiding this condo and this experience has tainted my confidence in the Airbnb concept."

After I had left the house for one week, the host notified me that they lost two cups and requested the compensation for the whole set of cups.  The most ridiculous was that Airbnb agreed to their claim and requested me to compensate 64 pounds to the host.  That converted to 32 pounds per cup!The truth was that we did not lose or damage any stuff in the host's house.  When we checked in, we did not have a checklist.  I did not know how many plates, forks, blankets they provided.  The host can actually claimed any loss maliciously and Airbnb would only listen to the host.

I later called her because there was a sewage smell in the condo and she told me there was no issue.  We never did figure out the reason for the odor, but opened up the sliding glass doors which appeared to help.  From my experience the risk involved in booking travel at hotels is minimal and issues are addressed quickly. A much better option than Airbnb."

I spoke to several people at AIR BNB who were no help and didnt care, and told me the problem was with the HOST, they tried to find me alternate accommodation, which were miles from where we wanted to be, and sub standard,  I went on to re book somewhere else.  at 6am the host called me to tell me that AIR BNB had double booked her property and again this was cancelled.  so now, with a refund policy of up to 15 days, they have 2 lots of payments to refund me (thousands of pounds) and I have nowhere to take the kids (to see Grandparents after lockdown) and nothing is available with days to go plus all the prices have shot up anyway.

Last year when the pandemics just started several reservations were cancelled by Airbnb specialists under condition ""no penalty for host and guest"". Sounds great, isn't it? This year I have discovered that my balance is $787 negative for the reservation I have never got paid for. So, I started hosting people again, they pay to Airbnb, but I am not paid until I repay the negative balance on my account.  Airbnb returned my money to the guest (I assume at least the guest got the money back!) and kept the guest money for the corporation.That is called stealing. I tried to call customer service three times, after being put on hold while they were ""verifying something"" , the phone calls got disconnected. I have a feeling they are just hanging up on me.

When I rebooked a new stay, I decided to take the two installment payment route because of travel uncertainty in case I got in a similar situation again.Well now that my second payment is up, I can’t use the travel credit I have. This is something that wasn’t mentioned to me when I spoke to one of the Airbnb agents. I have been on the phone since morning trying to find someone to help me and everyone keeps telling me that they can’t help me. I even went to say that I need to use that credit before it expires and no help or compassion was shown. It’s the ultimate slap in the face. Now I have an upcoming payment and according to the supervisor I spoke with, I have to pay out of pocket while I have a credit sitting in my account. It’s ridiculous, the worst customer experience one could face. On top of that, I also got conflicting information from an agent who said that I could cancel my booking, get a refund then use that to rebook. Well, when I spoke to a supervisor, they said that was impossible. I’m still hoping that I can get to someone who has some type of compassion with customer experience to help me.

Airbnb just suggested that I should move out (without any refund or compensation) and book a new place if I wasn’t happy. I couldn’t believe their response so I asked to speak to a manager. Was told a manager would contact me within 24h. More than 24h have now passed and I have not been contacted. What this means is that Airbnb is only a comparison site.

He constantly tried to lure my sons to go off with him to the point where my children could not go outside unaccompanied. He threatened my young son with violence for pressing keys too loudly on a keyboard. I believe the words were ""im going to smash your f'in head in"" He had previously admitted that he had a restraining order against him preventing him from going near his own kids!!  We were forced to move accomodation through fear for our safety and Airbnb promised we would be refunded. However after booking a last minute alternative which cost way more than we could afford we were told by Airbnb that because the host had complained about hygiene (which was an absolute lie as I had cleaned the property thoroughly prior to leaving) we would not be refunded. I told Airbnb that this man was dangerous and that if they continue to allow him to list there would be an incident but they did not seem to care. In fact they completely ignored me.

I called into report the damage.  The link the agent sent me didn't work and I told her that for one week because she started the conversation as if I were a traveler and not the host.  I guess this is why the link didn't work..  I sent the agent the photos of the damages and receipt for the cost of replacement.  She said she would take care of it.  A week later, I call back in about the payment for damages.  Another agent said,  nothing was submitted and that I needed to submit the claim a different way and the agent gave me incorrect.  I filed the claim which was over $500, now I  being told that it was after 14 days. I have proof in my Airbnb mailbox that I was asking over and over, how to submit my claim. The Million Dollar coverage for damages is a scam.  They jerk you around, hoping you don't file your claim or making hard to submit a claim because they really don't want to cover the cost of damages of guests who never pay when they destroy your home.

Sadly our trip 2021 has also been cancelled due to Covid. Our flights have been cancelled. Refund policy has been updated and Oyfrid has decided to retain our 50% deposit.

They charge all hosts for damage insurance but when you actually have an incident and try to get reimbursed, they take weeks without even responding to messages. Calling them is completely useless as apparently the only people who can do anything are supervisors but they do not existing when you speak to the representatives who take the calls. This is a disgusting way to run a company. AirBnb's sole source of income comes from the hard work and dedication of their hosts and they turn around and treat these same hosts horrendously. I wish someone with an actual concern for the wellbeing of the people who are funding them would start a company to complete with this awful company but unfortunately they have a monopoly on this industry and anyone looking to rent out a property must deal with them and be subject to their abusive and unethical treatment."

Owner got involved with airbnb, after 2.5 days and owner getting snippy with me because airbnb could not get the site to work, I took a pass.  2nd desired destination:  Got through booking to point of i.d. and photo upload.  Tried two different i.d.s, took new pictures of each every time it came back with picture quality error, tried at least 10 times.  Called customer service, said up to 24 hours to handle (hold expires in under 24 hours), luckily got escalation contact quickly, another hour+ of more new photos and tries and their only solution was to (during COVID to boot!) get another camera or cell phone to take photo with or go out and get someone to give me a different photo i.d.  Can't book if can't get past this and can't get past this.  AIRBNB WASTED AT LEAST 16 HOURS OF MY TIME WITH THEIR WEBSITE ISSUES, POLICIES, AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  NEVER AGAIN!"

The hosts graciously refunded us while Airbnb kept $600+ in ""service fees"", and did not respond to a request for refund we made on Tuesday morning.When we investigated and discovered France is going into a 4th COVID lockdown and her family advised her against traveling until she's vaccinated, so we decided to re-book (with the same gracious hosts) on Tuesday night.""Coincidently"" it wasn't until a full day later (Wed night) that Airbnb responded to our refund request (36 hours after contacting them) saying they wouldn't honor a refund because we have an ""overlapping booking"" (which didn't exist at the time the request was made 36 hours earlier) - despite them having full visibility of the timestamps and chain of events.There are plenty of short term rental companies much less heartless than Airbnb - if you want to avoid a situation like mine, don't use Airbnb."

It was very good price at that time ($316/4 nights.) Got confirmed/reminded two days before arrival by Airbnb, but when we arrived Host said Airbnb canceled their account and referred us to call them for a refund. We were shocked and asked Airbnb to find us other place with the same cost rather than for current market rent, because it was spring break now. It took them 4 hours to solve nothing, except gave us a credit of $31 with some referral sites to book somewhere else with 9-12 miles away for $510/4nights around 6:30PM. Even I called them 3 times after the first call to ask them to call me back for solution, but received no response. During this time it was extremely stressful and scary moment of our lives to stand on the strange and crowded street with a fear of hate crime recently against Asian-American. Mean while a curfew would be at 8 PM, we had to make a decision to rent the same place with new price $630/4nights, which was better than the sites that Airbnb provided such as location, public transportation, deal with booking again, and travel time to other location with a short time of searching information about that place.  After that, we asked them to increase us credit coupon, but helpless even requested to talk with Manager and higher Manager. I wonder if those Managers had skill of managements at all, at least listen to all 4 conversations that they recorded every time I called in order to know that their Customer Service was too slow and irresponsible to respond to us in time manner. Not only that they didn't care about the fact of curfew and hate crime against Asian-American to put in their accounts to offer us better solution. Curiously, if they said Host canceled it: why they could cancel in such last minute and Airbnb did not have any policy to bide them such as penalty, or charge them some costs to give to their victims? Ruin our planed trip! Extremely UNSATISFIED and DISAPPOINTED!!!"

I booked a reservation three months ago, yesterday I received an email that my reservation was cancelled.  One week before my trip.  I tried to call and the representative stated that they could not verify my identity, not sure why this wasn't done three months ago and they waited until one week before my stay.  Instead of putting my reservation on hold until this was resolved they completed cancelled on me.  I had to try and find alternate accommodations which of course with one weeks notice were double in price, not to mention the location was different so other excursions had to also be rescheduled.   Not only did the new accommodations cost me double but I will not receive my refund for at least 15 days, so now I have paid for a room that is cancelled and have also had to pay for the new accommodations.   I also tried to log back into their app so check on my refund and they have me completely blocked.  Lesson learned I will read all reviews in he future."

We booked months in advance an apartment in Sydney we spoke with the host multiple times confirming all was OK even two weeks before the date of arrival to be assured everything was OK and ready to go. Less then a week until arrival and we get a message at 2:18AM stating there is urgent Strata works which was later revealed by the hosts agent that the owner was looking for long term tenants and had obviously found some and cancelled there listing on Airbnb and in the process cancelled our booking. There is no support for the customer if the roles were reversed the customer would be out of pocket there deposit which in our cases would have been $600 whereas the host gets a pidly $100 “fine” and in our case the host has rented the property out long term so we can’t even leave a bad review for the host because they will no longer be on Airbnb. We were offered a $135 Airbnb voucher but why the hell would want to book again on Airbnb if any host can cancel a reservation so last minute when the prices for other such accomodation is so much more expensive leaving us out of pocket. We called and spoke to Airbnb’s contact centre explaining what had happened and we were just looking for an alternative to this Airbnb compensation and we were hung up on. There is absolutely no support for the consumer how can Airbnb get away with this is beyond me, there customer service over the phone was pathetic we calmly kept asking the customer service what will Airbnb do in these situations when we don’t want to use Airbnb’s compensation and we’re hung up on."

This is my first experience with Airbnb and I doubt I will ever do it again.   The host cancelled our reservation 10 days before Spring Break in Florida. This left little to no ability to get further reservations. (Not Airbnb’s fault ) However they were slow to respond and issue a refund and I needed to rebook right away not days later.  I did finally get the email saying they are refunding and giving me a $200 voucher for rebooking good for 30 days.  Since I had already rebooked (and had to pay ($900 more) they won’t let me use it.  It was overall a huge hassle and you also aren’t allowed to review the hosts if they cancel your reservations.  I am not sure why the host cancelled other than they had just bought out the original host I booked under and tried to get me to book with them directly and not pat the Airbnb fee. I declined and was cancelled a few days later.

I made the mistake of booking an apartment in Spain using USD, my credit card currency. My host told me he would charge me 150€/ night. Airbnb charged me US$184/ night which was much higher than any rate I found on the internet. When I took it up with them, the “specialist” kept saying they charged me the prices in USD and they didn’t do any currency conversion, which was of course a blatant lie. After a protracted conversation he finally admitted that the “ automatic currency converter” they used was OANDA. According to OANDA, 150€ came out to be US$178. I had conversations with more than one Airbnb representative on this. No one was willing or able to explain the 3% discrepancy between this and $184, which was actually a hidden fee Airbnb would not admit to.  I found from the internet that other travellers also wrote about this 3% additional currency conversion charge which Airbnb never mention anywhere in its website. In addition, Airbnb also calculated their service fees  based on the jacked-up room prices. In other words, I was overcharged twice. Luckily my host agreed to give me a full refund when I cancelled, and I was able to rebook  in Euros. Lesson: always pay Airbnb in the local currency. You can go to your Profile to make the choice."

I had last year opted to use Airbnb for a trip to Santorini. Due to Covid-19 I could not fly so I had to cancel the reservation. The app only gave me one option which was to get travel credit. This can be used for another trip at anytime within a year. Recently I contacted Airbnb as I wanted a refund - something I am entitled too as per the UK government. I initially spoke to a woman called Beatrice who's response was 'we cannot refund you your money and I'm not sure why'. So I could sense this would be an uphill battle as the customer service representative did not have a clue. After around a week of arguing with them they said as I chose the option for credit they cannot refund me. I stated I had no other option and they could not evidence anything to say I could have selected something else. I don't normally write reviews but had to in this case. I would advise to not use this company because if anything goes wrong, if you need help or god forbid a refund, you have no chance. Absolute rubbish."

I booked a decent looking apartment in the Temple Bar area with lovely views of Ha'penny Bridge. Just hours before my flight, the host sent a message to say that the apartment was flooded and offered other properties that I was not interested in. The host said he was doing all he can and promised one of the recommendations was close by and in good condition. Of course it was far from the truth and the flat was not clean and had essential things I had asked about missing. When i arrived, the flat was open and the key I was asked to retrieve from a lock box across the road did not open the flat. I raised this with the host and he sent me to another apartment that I had previously rejected. He said if I wasn't happy I should call airbnb support which I did. They provided no support, instead they finally suggested I contact the host directly for a refund and I had paid through airbnb. The chauffeur who picked me up from the airport helped me find alternative accommodation. He also investigated the claims and realised that the host didn't manage the apartment that I booked and reported flooded but was used as a bait to get reservations, cancel at the last minute and offer properties which are sub-standard accommodations. He gets a premium for the 'fake flat' and at the last minute try to get people into flats that should cost a third of the price.Interestingly, the flat which was supposedly flooded was available for rent the very next day. I raised this with airbnb but it was dismissed. I also sent a witness statement from the chauffeur and that was dismissed too. This was my first time using airbnb and it is definitely my last.If it was available my rating will be -5. Zero will be too high."

A corresponding appeal was created in support, where I was offered two options, to return the money to my creditcard or to  get a promotional code for future bookings, which would be really helpful due to tough situation in tourism industry.  I took their side and agreed to get a promo code that was valid for one year.  As a result, I decided to use this promo code recently, because as you know it was extremely problematic to do it before, almost the whole world is in lockdown, travel is virtually unavailable.  It turned out that the promotional code expired about a month ago, the programs for extending promotional codes due to the pandemic do not apply to my promotional code for some reason, my request to simply return the money to my card according to the first scenario was refused.  In fact, the company fraudulently stole my funds, providing me with a promotional code that was physically impossible to use during its validity period and unreasonably refusing to renew it, although they stated that all promotional codes will be automatically renewed until the end of 2021.  I strongly advise evading this fraudulent company.  (My promocode EXZJPABW)"

Airbnb had the bulk of the payment (nearly a thousand dollars). A week before the stay when the final payment was due I got an email on a Friday evening saying my reservation was cancelled because the payment didn't go through. I called support who told me to call my bank. My bank verified that my card was good and that no transactions had been attempted by Airbnb. Airbnb offered no help and the home was rented to someone else less than a half day after they cancelled my reservation so I could not re-book it. My family had flown across the country for this stay, had requested time off work, arranged pet sitters, etc. Because it is spring break week finding another place had been very difficult."

I study a properties extensively (particularly the reviews) before booking and plan well ahead. But recently I had a first time experience of a host canceling on me at the last minute (within a week) and it really caused major problems for my vacation trip. What really got me thinking is the realization that Air BnB is nothing more than a website run by just a few geeks in California somewhere. They take your money months in advance but offer next to ZERO service for a cancelation event. There is no one you can talk to. Little to no feedback. I just felt totally screwed over and had to do all the work in making alternative arrangements (which cost me more money in a different location on another platform). Yes, Air BnB refund your money, yes they offer you and pathetic pittance of money to re book using Air BnB and yes they say the host will receive a bad review and a penalty but there is no way of know that. So far all I have recieved is a few computer generated emails and no refund yet. You would think Air BnB would be all over a cancelation and really help the guest out. This is NOT the case at all. It's like they absolutely don't give a hoot. It is nothing but a website for hosts to use and it seems to me that Air BnB do very little except make policies and take your money. Great business for them. I doubt I will ever use again after this experience. If I do it will be with extreme caution."

If so, airbnb were always very supportive in resolving issues. Recently I’ve had a spate of guest’s stealing, damaging and abusing my home. When a guest stole over $2000 worth of Xmas presents and personal electronics from my home, after months of emails, and a long list of requirements (which I provided) Airbnb simply dismissed the entire claim and then simply closed the claim. I had photos of the damage and even CCTV footage of the guest stealing red-handed and still Airbnb refused to accept my claim. I emailed Susan Wheeldon, Hum Hong Siew and even Brian Chesky, but not even a response from any of these top tier management team. Ever since Sam McDonagh left Airbnb it has gone down hill in terms of customer service. Airbnb has become obsessed with their bottom dollar and fail to recognise when a guest has steals/damaged property.I’ve since closed my account as I don’t feel safe having guests in my home, given that they potentially have free range and Airbnb will simply brush off the claim.DON’T TRUST AIRBNB!"

Juan at airbnb support said the host can’t charge and that he would cancel the booking for me, so I stayed somewhere else via hotels.com (who are wonderful). Juan didn’t cancel the booking and I lost my money. Then I complained to Angelo and Renart. Nobody helped me and I lost all of my money even though I didn’t stay there! I’ve read that the hosts take deposits and find ways of keeping them. Airbnb support is terrible, they don’t care about customers, only their hosts, don’t use them! Go for a proper website like hotels.com or travel republic. You never know what you’re gona get with airbnb. If you will stay somewhere with airbnb, my only advice is to ask the host everything you can think of in advance, don’t book until you are convinced the host is a fair and reasonable person!

We were lucky that we were able to find a dog friendly place, but not nearly as nice as the first place (and the credit could not be applied).I emailed the owner who told me he had this problem numerous times with Air BNB. I asked him to call me to explain but air BNB blocks phone numbers. When we arrived in Whitefish I went to the house and knocked on the door to find out info from the people that were renting (thinking that maybe it was double booked thru VRBO or some other outfit). They had booked approx 2 weeks before us. Clearly this was a technical issue; presumably Air BNB fault. I have had numerous conversations with them and the only answer they have is “sorry” taking no responsibility. I will never book thru them again. They are a shameful company with no accountability."

Off the back of the conversation, I booked the apartment. Less than 24 hours later, it’s cancelled because they said for the period I want it’s ‘4 night minimum stay’ which is not the rule on their listing. So I contact air bnb who then tell me the host said they felt it was a risk to covid and that’s why the cancelled. My question is, they knew I was booking and none of the other dates are blocked on the calendar except the dates I’ve booked so if you feel covid is a risk why are you accepting bookings? That’a not the reason. Something not a lot of people realise beforehand is the host can’t see your picture or anything until you book and all of a sudden they see your details and then cancel based on what they think they know of you. Air BnB don’t seem to help with this because they don’t take note of pattern of behaviour for Airbnb hosts either. This is why they get so many complaints because the hosts are allowed to do what they want and I get it’s their homes but unless we have bad reviews as customers or are blacklisted, there’s no reason for hosts to be able to select who they want based on looks or perception.  This has happened 3 times on the platform with hosts telling me I look too young and they don’t want to risk parties etc (I’m in my 30s) or another who said they are concerned about potential damage that may be made... from what evidence or reason other than my profile picture do you have to make these bloody assumptions??

It had a $170 cleaning fee but had 30 bags of trash (i.e. weeks of trash) at the front door when we checked-in. There was zero maintenance done to the front - only entry - walkway which was all ice. When we tried to contact the owner/host we received no response. Then, prior to checkout we used ""resolution center"" to try to contact the owner/host. This was a waste of time as the response from Airbnb was, essentially, ""too bad"". They stated that its up to the owner to provide any refund. In other words, Airbnb offers zero assistance after you use their site to find a decent and clean place to sleep. We have now opened a dispute via PayPal but that will take some time. And then we may have to dispute the charge through the credit card...

Though instead they accept the bad guests request for their bad review to be removed but the superhost is left with a spiteful and clearly nasty and biased and untrue review from the bad guest. Which Airbnb refuses to remove and gives no true intellectual reasons to why the clear policy breaches in the bad guests review is chosen to be left up over reasonable review to the bad guest, the review gets removed? I believe they are trying to keep people circulating and booking places despite the risk involved with on sending a obviously bad and difficult guest to another good superhost all because Airbnb has become greedy. 6 years as a supper host over 350 good reviews, and Airbnb has gone down hill in management of upholding their own review and privacy policy"

Long story short, the apartment did not have all of the amenities listed in the AirBnB profile. So, I let the host know I would not stay and requested a full refund from him. I moved out the same day I moved in, and scrambled to find another place to stay last minute. The first night I stayed in a hotel. The second night I found another AirBnB place, where I was charged another service fee, for the remaining the vacation. The third day, I contacted  customer service to get my refund. They refused to reimburse the service fee of $200 because I missed their arbitrary deadline of requesting the refund. Needless to say, it will be a while before I book through AirBnB again."

1242,Hannah Rosie,GB,3 reviews,"Thursday, February 25, 2021, 09:43:40 PM",1,£1400 refund owed!!,"I had booked accommodation through Airbnb, a Georgian loft apartment in Dublin, Ireland for 19th Feb - 21st Feb 2021, to sleep 20 people. Paying a 50% deposit of £1,420.40. I recently contacted the host to discuss the booking, as it was becoming clear that the reservation would not be allowed to go ahead in line with English and Irish Government guidelines; it would have been illegal for the host to accommodate so many people. The host was very unresponsive and eventually told me that he did not know how to issue a full refund, as Airbnb were holding his funds. I contacted the Airbnb support centre who advised me that if I were to cancel my booking the host would have the option to issue me with a full refund, I followed this instruction and cancelled the booking. The host then became unresponsive again, and I have not heard back from him since then. I have been through dispute resolution with the Airbnb support centre twice, and both times the host has refused to provide me with a refund. I understand that Airbnb has a Covid-19 policy in place, but my grievance is that, if Airbnb had not advised me to cancel in order to allow the host to issue a full refund, I wouldn't have, and therefore I would still have had the option to move my booking to a different date, or the host would have been forced to cancel and therefore I would have received a full refund. But by following the advice given to me by an support agent, I have been left with nothing. I have made this booking on behalf of 20 other people, who don't understand why they cannot receive a refund, when the booking was not able to go ahead.As I have mentioned, I have spoken with Airbnb 'support' many times now, and I am getting nowhere. I asked an agent yesterday to advise me how to escalate this and he provided me a link to leave feedback; I do not wish to leave feedback; I wish to obtain the refund that we are rightly owed."

All funds paid through Paypal and received an address to view after moving in. I texted the host for distance to city/beach and I was told it was close by at ten mins., but false advertisement on the ad stated she had a car then, I was told there was no car. So I inquired about transportation the Host stated you can use taxi/ bus or rent a car. I informed her I would be turning my rental back in soon. So I informed her I had my 83 year old mother who couldn't walk distance. I decide to rent because I thought It would be easy to navigate and get a taxi. Funds where paid up front and address given through Whatsapp. Upon travel I noted the condo was difficult to get to because of 1/4 mile long rocky dirt road and long distance to walk to front gate. The admin person who let me in stated it may be difficult for a taxi. After he left I noted the internet never would connect, no hot water, home smelled of mildew, no storage for food items. Cat lurking around the condo even got in house before I could leave out. What make things worse is that my son is allergic to cats. To sum things up the host was informed of things as we found them. She said she wasn't aware of boiler not working so no hot water and stated she would check on it. Later, to call back to say a plumber would come the next day. The network and PW given never worked and we work from home. I didn't want to keep complaining to her about problems I found I couldn't connect to the services. At that point I knew that wasn't the place for my family.In closing, I had to take my family to Fiesta Inn in the city to stay because of these issues which, cost 72.00 a night. Airbnb is stating I didn't cancel but, I canceled so many times and received an amount of refund and I also contacted the host as well. Although, it was difficult to cancel I have info in my history of all the times I tried to cancel that same day then, again after being informed it still showed condo being rented by me. There system needs servicing or Im being scammed. Even the Host stated she couldn't work it out on her side. I really don't understand how people don't know there business skills to keep things going, if true. Airbnb stated well we don't give money back unless extreme case because you register more than 28 days. My registration was Feb 14-March 15, 2021 and no where it stated you can only stay a limited time. The total amount taken 1016.00. So my 83 year old mom, son and I got a hotel and Airbnb later only offered me 36.00. So why are they doing business? I've seen too many reviews since my encounter of them withholding funds. there stocks are and I understand why! Beware"

We don’t live in a perfect world. When something goes wrong they are at a complete loss as to how to correct the situation. The first reservation I ever made with them was the first disaster. The host couldn’t make the dates that we had ALREADY booked available so he canceled. So he said anyway, Airbnb still showed it as good. Imagine our surprise to not have a place to stay. I called support expecting a reasonable way to transfer the money I had already paid into a different booking. Well nobody on the telephone could help me. I was told I would get a call from a support agent shortly. Two hours later I called back wondering if they forgot. I called again 2 more times. Finally after sitting in a parking lot for 4-1/2 hours in a car full of kids I got a call! That conversation took two more hours and because they took so long we weren’t able to find anything for that night!                   Another problem is that you don’t know where you’re booked until after the fact (in one case not even then). If I had access to any information about the actual complex my second reservation was I would have never made it. I ended up at a crime infested complex with ineffective security. Somebody peeled the tags off our license plate while we were parked RIGHT NEXT TO THE SECURITY POST! We asked security how they missed that and they said we were making it up. We checked out early with Airbnb promising to refund the balance, but days later I can’t get anyone on the telephone that can tell me the amount of my refund or if I can forward it to another reservation. I was told to expect a call three days ago and again 5 hours ago. This is the ONLY company I have ever dealt with that can’t tell me my own balance. Thank god there’s competitors."

Second stay I find out that electricity plug is straight under the sink... If sink started leaking that would be interesting shituation. Third stay - don't bother to expect warm water (I guess would be costly), but that's more about greediness of the owners. I asked about the water and was blatantly lied by owner... 30 minuts of running water it still was ice cold.Another stay - place was illegally converted without any inspection ir approval. THAT shouldn't surprise anyone... Clearly Airbnb doesn't care about anything, so why would they care about your safety???And of course none of these places had any smoke detector, extinguisher or even anything for you to get out should it catch on fire...Btw, i still gave good ratings to ""hustling renters"" as they comply with Airbnb requirements perfectly (or friend who ordered Airbnb for me did) but Airbnb doesn't care, doesn't require apparently a thing from people who rent out... So Airbnb has low rating from me..."

I rent my furnished apartment for $80 per night, everything included (Netflix, Prime, Alexa, WiFi, etc.).  I also offer complimentary housekeeping on occasion --- So my expenses are a bit high.  My rate is very, very reasonable given my expenses --- but I do earn a bit of money at the end of the day.I have a vested interest in the property.  I purchased the real estate, furnished the apartment, maintain the property, pay the utilities and property tax.  I have a LOT at stake.AirBnB has very little at stake.  They are simply an advertising platform and run a website.  That's it!Here's AirBnB's cut on a 45 night stay:Additional money collected from the Guest over and above the nightly rate:Guest Service Fee $393.74Occupancy Tax      $482.09Deducted from the Host before payment is made:Host Service Fee   $111.25So the GUEST pays $4584.13 and the HOST earns $3597.05 for 45 nights!  That is a $1,000 difference for using an advertising platform.But that's not the worst.  AirBnB does not give the host all of the money at once.  They release 30 days rent at a time.  So the money trickles in to the HOST, even though the GUEST pays 100% upfront.But that's not the worst.  Should AirBnB decide to ""adjust"" a HOSTS account, they simple deduct payments due, and it's up to the HOST to fight with AirBnB to get their money back . . . . money that has been automatically deducted from their BANK ACCOUNT!Yes, AirBnB says there are different ways for a HOST to be paid, but all tied back to a bank account or credit card where AirBnB can ""nilly willy"" take funds on a whim without justification leaving the HOST to try to ""prove"" to AirBnb that the ""adjustment"" may have been erroneous.  Well, this is one reason why there is a class action suit pending against the company.Zillow.com has a much more friendly platform, no additional fees to either the host or guest, and a written agreement that can be easily modified on a more personal level, between host and guest without AirBnB deducting their ""commission"" for legitimate cancellations, and other ""upsets.""This is simply a bad company on every level and for everyone involved, EXCEPT Brian Chesky, AirBnB CEO.  I recommend using a more reasonable platform like Zillow.com, Trulia.com and a few others for non-commissioned short term rentals cutting out the middleman, aggravation, and upset.I simply can not recommend on any level."

The first request was rejected because I wasn't staying 7 nights however the owner did not state this was a ""requirement"" anywhere in his description of the property. Clearly he wanted to make more money but I spent alot of time narrowing my options , only to be rejected because he wasn't clear in his communication that he required a 7 night minimum. Is this what airbnb is now? Greedy condo owners that sneakily hide their 7 night minimum and wait for the best sale? The second property owner did the same thing. Again, I spent more time I  didn't have searching for another property,  only for the owner to say this time that the property was already booked, yet it was clearly available when I booked it. What is going on? Now my card has a $1,300  hold on it for a condo that the owner had no intention on renting to me probably also because he too wants a 7 night minimum without stating it in the description. Apparently they wait for the highest bidders to come in. Is airbnb an ebay auction now?  I wasted 2 hours of my time today getting nowhere with fake ads on airbnb with greedy property owners.

If it is the case, WHY they listed the available date? Airbnb listed the available date, take ALL your money in advance, but they can refuse your BnB request after 24 hours. This is a SCAM practise. What if... the owner refuse your request after 24 hours, where is my money? Shall I start everything again?IF the BnB is NOT availble, WHY listed from the very beginning?"

I hope it was worth it AirBnB over a small $300 stay."

I unfortunately recently rented a ""cozy home"" that turned out to be more of a ""crack house"". The windows were barred, the house was a shack more than a house, literally looked abandoned. The inside was nasty and filthy. I canceled this booking as soon as arriving there, no way would I have my team stay there. Of course, the host delayed getting back to me on refund so I didn't escalate to airbnb until the following day and they said it was just outside the time I needed to ask them for a refund.. I sent them a ton of pictures showing how horrible the place was and got no help. This is how Airbnb and the host scammed me for over $600 for a 3-night stay where it looks like homeless people probably go and stay there for free. Sticking to traditional hotels and rental sources. I don't know how airbnb can let properties be so misleading and then not help.."

In booking, I asked the host if there were stairs.  The host, Dave, said there were 6-8 stairs.  OK, I thought, I can do a few stairs, so I booked.  The night before moving in, he sends details and I find out it's a second floor walk-up! I'm using a walker. I contacted the host, who said he'd give me a 50% refund or more if someone books his place. When I ask if I'll get the 50% up front and more later if the place books, he changes his mind and decides I'll only be refunded for the nights someone books to cover.  Now he is offering no refund. Apparently, I should have known that an apartment wouldn't have an elevator, even when I asked about stairs.I called AirBnB for assistance. ""Carl"" reviewed the situation and determined that AirBnB would not assist because I should know that a 2nd floor apartment would not have an elevator.This is about an organization supporting misinformation, unsafe practices, and mistreatment of physically disabled persons."

Airbnb customer service didn’t even help and there was no effort of trying. It doesn’t make sense that the company can’t give refund for people who have bad experiences during the stay. Like how tf was I supposed to know 24 hours after my stay that on my second night a RAT AND 3 MICE would be in the garage area eating through trash left by the owner. How would I know my friend bed would collapse under her while she was sleep. They literally have the most ass backwards apologies. I’m putting the review  I put on Airbnb on here cause they won’t post it. Guest #1-this is literally the house from hell-walls were dirty -there was garbage under the beds and couches-there are no cleaning supplies available for guest to clean, we had to provide our own broom, trash bags, and soap-the jacuzzi tub in the master bedroom is broke-while my friend was sleep in the master bed the frame collapsed -there were stains on every single bed spread and the floor-the were rats and mice in the garage eating through garbage the owner had left there from the last guest and didn’t clean-Host was notified about all above issues and told us he would be by to assist and never came. He did send someone to fix the garage he swore er could use but why would we use it when Jerry and his cousin in there having thanksgiving -pool was dirty and he wouldn’t take the robot out and didn’t tell us it was a charge to heat the pool till we arrived $75 a day-there were shoes by the pool and a whataburger cup floating in the pool with glow sticks at the bottom -the neighbors don’t like that the house is an Airbnb and have signs around to let you know -unfortunately my group had to stay because it would’ve been to hard to find a place for 10 people to stay in such short a time frame-Airbnb said there is nothing they can do for me and it is up to the host to give me the 40% refund we want. So let’s hope he can respond to this review and my request with some happy news unlike that house. -I will say the best part was the dinning room, it was the perfect size for our catered meal for our friends’ birthday!Guest #8-  water pressure in downstairs bathroom sink sucks. -Lack of cleaning supplies - no dresser or table big enough in downstairs room- light really dim - lack of pots and pans with lids. -garbage in garage-rodents in garage-bugs in upstairs bathroomGuest #5- sheets were yellow and had stains - towels had stains - a roach in the upstairs bathroom - didn't say that we need to provide ourselves with tissue or trash bags - didn't say we needed to pay for heated pool - said there was a cleaning crew but the house was not clean - old trash left in the garage - rodents in the garage Guest #6 Guest 6 - Everything’s outdated & broken. Disgusting bed sheets and towels. ROACHES. No soap/tissue or any basic household items/supplies. Furniture old, dirty, & bed was duct taped together. Leftover trash & hair everywhere."

Luckily I already was in good connection with my future hosts and booked directly with them even it was not my favourite way. Well, I was left with no choice!

As the pandemic grew worse and I started to understand my rights to a refund in these circumstances, I queried this with air Bnb and asked for the cash refund I was told I qualified for under the extenuating circumstances policy. They admitted in writing that it was a fault with their system but refused to give me my money back as I hadn’t flagged the error sooner, placing full blame on myself. I have been objecting this for 4 months now to no avail so have had to escalate to the financial ombudsman and take legal advice. I have read many similar revenues on social media of customers being treated this way and would recommend that legal complaints are filed. For the time being I have a useless voucher that cannot be used due to lockdowns and am £900 out of pocket.

Just tried to book a small 2 person cabin a few weeks in advance for my birthday. We've booked entire places before in the past with less time and have had no problem booking before (the actual homes though were never as nice as the pictures sadly). Found a nice cabin to stay in and the owner pre-approved us to stay in it but I wasn't able to book it. ""Safety Measure"" was put in to prevent people with fewer reviews to make reservations at ""late notice"" to prevent things such as ""parties"" 😑 safety measures my ass! Why should I not be able to book because the last guys I stayed at didn't bother leaving a review? Last moment.. now.. what erks me the most was while the owner of the cabin was trying to hold the dates for up us and we were trying to talk to airbnb to sort out the problem, someone else booked the place 🙃 fu*king great.. Birthday Oasis gone because the last people didn't give me a fu*king review and yet someone else had no problem with being so ""last minute"". And a party? It's me and my boyfriend.. thats not even a crowd. I don't understand though.. if I had a person wanting to stay in my cabin and I pre-approved them to stay, they should be able to stay at that point. It's my own damn property so why not? That mentality is just mind boggling. Fu*k airbnb, they're overrated and a bunch of glammed up sissy bast*rds wanting their money for a bunch of sh¡t sticks put together and considered ""beautiful vacation homes"".

I explained that I had not had a known exposure until 2 days after booking-I was told I could not get a refund or change my reservation dates. I was told I should ""read the policies better next time"". According to Airbnb you can not cancel your reservations for a full refund unless they were made prior to March 2020 when the WHO announced a global pandemic.

Guest clearly manipulated the COVID policy on the day of check in after trying other excuses to try to get out of the reservation the day before. We as hosts offered to split the cost of the last minute cancellation and offer a 50% refund even though our cancellation policy states no refunds. After the some back and forth with the guest she comes up with the COVID excuse for someone not in her traveling party. She calls Airbnb and Airbnb cancelled the reservation and provided a full refund without due process or considering the facts. Also forget about your deposit from guests with Airbnb if they damage something. It is almost impossible with Airbnb to claim damage against a guest whereas VRBO has an insurance policy option that the guest pre-pays for and thus their is no friction when accidental damage occurs and you go to claim that damage.

But in the case of a recent host who promised services they had no intention of providing and even knew about the issues in advance, airbnb refused to take any responsibility even for protecting future guests by insisting that the host was honest (legally compliant even) on their listing.  They used every get out clause they could scrape up and their resolution ""support"" is best described as a fob-off service to serve themselves.  When they knowingly keep advertising such a host, they  surely  deserve to be legally challenged under uk consumer and trading standards law? Time  must be coming.  Oh and a host's attempt to nobble a reviewer?  That's definitely illegal."

We were threatened that if we didn’t provide them with food/money they would destroy and steal our belongings.  The owner of home called them “harmless” and said Police drove by regularly to make sure.  WHAT!   Airbnb did NOTHING including not making sure this doesn’t happen to someone else.  We had to find alternative lodging and were completely out the money we paid through the Airbnb site.  Airbnb stance is their only responsibility is to make sure the house is clean and safe to stay inside.  Once you leave the doors of the house you (and your car, fiancée, belongings) are fair game.  Will never use them again and strong urge others to beware."

Remember that Airbnb will never stand on your side (unlike other platform). They are hosts’ watch dog. I wrote a one star review on a stay for mismatch description. They remove my review claiming I mention sensitive information. I asked customer service which part involves sensitive information. They said I mentioned building name. I can remove building name. They told me I only have one chance to write a review. Then why don’t they just keep the one star for the stay and remove my “sensitive review”. Nope they were just trying to find an excuse removing all low rating. I wish all other user staying there luck. The whole apartment building has very low rating on all other platform, but only on Airbnb has 4.8/5.0. Isn’t that amazing? The building is called Castle Beach Condos in Miami Beach. Btw, A/c is really loud. Room is already worn out in every corner. Entire building sharing one laundry (over 1,000 units in there). (The host took edited picture to make it clean. Airbnb removes all low rating).  that’s how I ended up having such a horrible stay there. Always, see if other platform has the same resource and check the rating elsewhere.

Their customer service is atrocious and is very argumentative. I stayed at an Airbnb in December 2019 until January 2020 and there was a pest infestation in the home. I contacted Airbnb about it and they refund part of the money and stated that they would give a gift certificate worth $400. The certificate ran out in January 2021, due to the CoVid 19 pandemic I was unable to travel and use the certificate. The customer service representative informed me that I would have to call back closer to the time it ran out, bear in mind I called them in the summertime to ask them to extend the certificate because I couldn't use it for obvious reasons. I called them back this month January 2021 to be informed that they wouldn't reinstate the $400 certificate because it had expired. The first representative offered me $200 instead of the $400 so I wanted to speak to a supervisor to get my full $400 back but no supervisor would talk to me so I had to wait until the next day to get a call back. Suprise surprise another representative called back who wasn't a supervisor started to argue with me on the phone. He didn't listen to what I had to say and also wasn't going to give the $200 that the previous representative offered me the day. In addition to this, if I took the $200 certificate the previous representative would have got into trouble. I didn't want to get the first representative into trouble so I decided not to take the $200. If you go on vacation don't book an Airbnb."

Please, no one should pay in advance if when you arrive at a place that is terrible, unsafe and not according to expectations, you can cancel and get your money.  Airbnb does not respect us as customers and in this first bad opportunity in many years as a user, it did not support us and refused to refund the amount paid.

We feared for our safety and the safety of our vehicle since there was only on-street parking. I went through all the channels of requesting a refund through the management company and Airbnb, but apparently my family's safety is not a concern for them. We ended up finding another Airbnb to stay at that cost twice as much, but Airbnb refused to refund our original rental. We never opened the front door. We left as soon as possible. Within an hour we read that there was a shooting in the neighborhood. My son was shot in a drive by shooting about a year earlier.

THe house I stayed at had numerous things broken, including the Master Bedroom door! The water smelled moldy in all the showers and the shower head in the Master bedroom had green and black mold on it.  Oh, and the owner doesn't allow you access to the thermostat!

There is absolutely no flexibility with airbnb cancellations and refunds, it's absurd. We used to book Airbnb for more than 6 years with my now husband.

I am new to their system.  The owner (who I later found out has a criminal record) asked me about it. I was honest and upfront and told him 4 people. Apparently it wasn’t an issue because he accepted the reservation.  Four days before I was to arrive the owner called me to tell me the oven wasn’t working. Told him I had planned on cooking and had to have a working oven. He promised to take care of getting A new oven.  I arrived to the house on 12/23/2020, he was attempting to repair the kitchen sink.  I drove 1500 miles and so close to Christmas I did t want to cancel and loose $4600.  I could tell the house hadn’t been cleaned to Airbnb standards so I filed a complaint within an hour of checking in; as per their policy.   I found mouse feces throughout the kitchen, rugs not cleaned, ceiling fans with thick dust and barely attached to the ceiling, mold throughout the house, curtain rods falling off the wall, smoke detectors without batteries, bugs, door hinges falling off, no lock on the back door, etc it was horrific.  I again complained to Airbnb I was sent to no less than 10 ambassadors. I called every hour on the hour begging them to help me with a refund.  I finally found someone who listened to my complaint on Christmas Day.   I had sent pictures all along to Airbnb of all the violations to health safety and the unsanitary conditions.  All my monies were tied up in the house.   I was issued a refund, cancelled my reservation on 12/29/2020  and a coupon for another stay.  The owner never made an attempt to send a cleaning person, threatened us that if we didn’t vacate immediately he’d call the police. Problem was the slum lord needed the money and refused to cancel the reservation earlier than the 29th.   He began to file complaints about me that I had too many people in the house, I had documentation proving he knew there would be 4 people. Claimed we had a party, (me and my kids who don’t drink).  Claimed my dog howled all night, said I yelled at his employee.  He claimed I had 5 children, one set of twins named Laura and Lauren.  Apparently he got the names from my daughters social media because Laura and Lauren are her coworkers.  He drove by the house stalking us.  He was angry because he was losing a lot of money.  Even though Airbnb issued me a refund for the obvious health and safety issues and gave me a coupon they allowed the home owner to file a complaint about me in order to freeze my account so I can’t book in the future.  I have dozens of pictures and video of his home.  I was sent an email from Airbnb that I was being investigated I was to reply within 48 hours.  I did reply and asked them what I was being investigated for.  I have heard nothing from them.  I’ve called three times and no one will assist me.  I have emailed the CEO twice, he hasn’t even acknowledged my email.  Their customer service is horrible.  I don’t understand how they can stay in business.

The host also informed me that the association does not allow short term leasing anymore and I was to lie about who I was or what I was doing there if anyone asked. Well the host is still on their platform advertising with the fake address and lying about the one free parking space. How can I trust anything they have? Here I told them, provided proof of all this and yet the host is allowed to lie like this. I went way over budget due to the host lying about the parking.

It took a week for airbnb to tell me the amount of refund I should request from my host - being pretty rude to me throughout the conversation. When I told them that I also needed a refund on the proportional amount of tax they said - ""service fees and tax is always nonrefundable.""I cannot fathom that it's legal to charge more tax than the cost of the good or service. It's just a matter of time until they are sued for illegally taking people's money. I didn't ask for a refund of the service fee (which is also a % based on the cost of the stay), because I knew they wouldn't give it to me. I'll take up the tax with my credit card company, since I know this is not right.It seemed like the representatives were trained in torture - honestly. They were extremely passive aggressive, avoided my questions, asked me the same questions over and over, gave me different responses to the same issue, and overall made my life a living hell for the whole time I was speaking with them.I will never use Airbnb again."

After a battle we were finally rewarded a coupon that I’ve tried to use 10 times to no avail and when I call I get some bogus story on how it becomes valid soon and must just need more time. One time the person told me it had actually expired. You can see how this is grossly infuriating. This issue has still not been resolved, almost a year later.

I am both a host and guest. It now takes on average 6 minutes to pass the robot voice on their call center. I then got through to their custómer service TWICE with no result. I had a COVID incident where my flights were cancelled and then was refused access to the destination country due to Denmark being blacklisted (together with the UK) on the day. It turns out AirBnb HAS NO COVID policy as they falsely claim. And I got only a measily 28% refund - a huge loss as I had booked 6 nights. My advice is to use booking dot com or a simple hotel instead. My advice is to avoid AirBnB at all cost (even as a host)

Every guest is charged a service fee whenever a reservation is booked. This fee is a percentage of the total reservation cost and can vary based on the amount. I was told by an Airbnb member of staff:""The host pays less than the guest - the general rule is as follows also according to the article I sent you:Most guests pay a service fee that is under 14.2%Most hosts pay a service fee of 3%So yes you pay 4-5 times more than the host""This is unfair!! When I asked for a lower service fee I was told that was not possible because they cannot override the process.Why guest has to pay 5 time more? Could you not divide this charge 50 by 50? So the guest and the host would pay the same amount of money?? That would be fair!! You can lose your guest because of that and become less popular web to book an accommodation by people. I do not want to pay more for the service fee than host. It should be equal!!"

Policies are written in such a way that it helps only one group....and that is Airbnb only. I have tried to help our guests to navigate through some of these policies and you could never get a good answer since you can only contact airbnb through a messenger type communication system. So after explaining my case to the customer service representative and I asked him to communicate with our guests to help them re-book, I was told that customer service rep are not allowed to discuss matters with our guests and after chatting with my guest and asked my guest to contact Airbnb directly  in order to solve the problem but to this day nothing has been resolved. Also Airbnb cancellation policies are terrible. I have to admit as a property owner we have found a very nice solution to their poor services. We increased cost of our properties on airbnb and decrease costs to our preferred channel VRBO. I would not recommend Airbnb as a property owner and I believe my guests are not happy either.SincerelyGabriel"

That didn't give us any towels, toilet paper or even a shower head but the condition of the mattress was what makes me write this. When I returned from my vacation I contacted AIRBNB right away and sent photos. The rental was 30 minutes from a very small town in Mexico with little cell service and the place itself had no service so I couldn't contact AIRBNB while I was there and the host was unresponsive. After 3 days at this place (NEVER getting towels or toilet paper!) and discovering the condition of the mattress we packed up and drove  60 minutes to the nearest hotel. Not only did I ask for a refund when I got back but wanted to report the unsanitary conditions. The reply from AIRBNB???>>> Sorry, you didn't contact us within 24 hours to make a complaint so no refund. Period. No mention of the shower, toilet paper, towels or the mattress. I just happened to discover the condition of the mattress when the sheet came loose the 3rd day or we would have left earlier. It looked like someone had a bloody nose (amoung other stains!) and nothing was done to clean it up. There wasn't even a mattress protector, just a thin sheet between our faces and that filth. AIRBNB does not care about your health or anything else."

They basically stole $200 from me and my family because we had to cancel based off of the city's new guidelines that came out months AFTER we had booked. This was unforeseen and yet we don't qualify for this cancelation. I would have accepted a gift card to continue using their services, but instead they decide to steal from their customers.

Airbnb thinks Hosts are more of a client for them than Guests and they kiss a*s. They ignored my messages and gave me a sugar coated response.

The Airbnb property was (and still is) advertised for a medium-high amount and suitable for pets (I have a cat). No reviews were shown. When I attempted to book the property the host suddenly added fees not discussed in the Airbnb listing, including an abnormally high cleaning fee and an extra charge for the cat. I accepted these charges (because insurance was really paying the bill). When it came time to check out, however, the host produced an extraordinary list of intensive cleaning tasks that she expected me to complete before checking out (despite having charged me for 8 - 10 hours of cleaning work). I refused, which provoked threats of immediate eviction and garnishing the security deposit. I involved Airbnb support, who were totally non-committal and provided no real support.I wrote a very accurate revuew, which I can support with photos and documentary evidence, which Airbnb have declined to publish. The property is still listed as having 0 reviews. So who's side is Airbnb on?"

Unlike other service providers, they take 100% control of the process when a damage claim is instituted. I've ascertained that a damage deposit isn't really taken from guests but rather their credit card details - in most cases this is a waste of time as guests that damage things either withdraw their details or cancel the cards. They have a host guarantee in place which is supposed to protect against things like this but it's more like a 'gotcha' insurance policy where they find any reason to wriggle out of paying.We recently had to run the gauntlet of this process with respect to a damaged television. I provided time stamped photos of the damage, the model and serial number as well as a link to the company providing the TV for its value. I further provided the replacement receipt for the new TV and offered that they can inspect the damage. They denied my claim - why...well I didn't have the original receipt for the TV that was damaged. This must be taken in context that by their design we have little if any control on which guests book our homes - for me the math really doesn't work, would rather go to another company which understands how rentals work: a damage deposit is given, our contract with guests is honored and we have control over the process."

Trashed our home  broke all the glasses, bed, blood on all carpets and rugs, up walls.  Completely trashed the whole house, left drugs everywhere   and left leaving both front and back door wife open.  We had to close the airbnb for a week to fix it up and carpet clean etc, and replace bedding glasses etc.  However airbnb didn't help! They ignore me for a month, let the man getaway with not paying when I requested money to fix it all, and didn't even let me review him!!! So don't trust reviews either.   They ignored me for a month of me sending messages, and phone calls, then when the month is up, get in touch saying its nearly to late, and to send in all my photo evidence, which I had already done, twice!!!!

I have been using airbnb for a while and all I got was good reviews, so I am really baffled right now.Even when there are real fraudulent activities, if a customer asks for the case be looked at again, the company should at least reopen the case and do some investigation instead of closing the customer’s account for no apparent reasons and irresponsibly saying that they no longer support the customer. This app may have good options for accommodations but their customer service is a joke."

It's completely fraud and I told them I have never this issue before. I lost 360 dollars just in 5 minutes without any reason. Stay away from Airbnb and I think they only trying to make host happy and they don't care anything about the guest. It's completely dishonest business."

One bathroom would be uncovered as un-attended-to, then the next, one kitchen counter filthy then one cabinet next. Painfully consistent discovery process while attempting to visit a new city and spend vacation with friends. All of which is a direct violation of Airbnb's highly marketed promise of an ""Enhanced Cleaning Protocol's Five-Step Process between each stay."" Speaking via app with Stay Local was at a snails pace and we were stuck with weekend assistance until the following Monday. Emails would go unanswered until the following day, etc.  Not a single Covid related show of concern or solution presented - instead a text stating $300 would be reimbursed for the inconvenience of the construction noise. Email sent to Stay Local included photos :  ""Please see attached photos as they serve as documentation for the disappointing and slightly DISTURBING (due to Covid) state of cleanliness upon arrival. Have to say, we have done extensive traveling since Covid and have not seen anything quite like this. It looked as if there hasn't been a cleaning in a long time, let alone since the last guest stayed. (Dust all over floor - even in common use spaces, dead bugs, toothpaste on mirrors/sinks, dirty counters, dirty bathroom floors, dirty windows, expired coffee as welcome, construction trash all over yard, etc.) After cleaning and attempting to make ourselves comfortable here, later today we found a pile of nail clippings in the living room and some more dead bugs. Difficult to capture just how gross that is to find...Also, please see attached documentation of trash in yard. ""YET,The real failure after all of this was not even Stay Local - it exposed Airbnb. Airbnb convinced our group of a supposed ""enhanced cleaning"" expectation. The illusion of a safe haven amidst Covid was trusted because of the priority Airbnb painted they were making for their customers. Yet, after sending all the photo evidence of a dirty home, sharing the unfolding horror of how our friends & family discovered each grossity, etc -- we were met with lack of interest, distrust, and in the end - a denial of ANY refund for a month-long stay. No solution offered but worse still, no consolation - no customer care. To think that Airbnb has created a whole advertising campaign about a 5 step cleaning process for Covid yet when held accountable - does nothing to protect travelers from irresponsible hosts. BEWARE.

If they're merely worried such restrictions MIGHT impact their travel, we offer a 75% refund.  AirBnB has completely ignored their own published COVID cancellation policies (which state that the host's policy will apply) to give full refunds without our consent, our input, or any recourse.  Requests to speak with a supervisor are simply ignored.  If they treat hosts that way, then they treat guests that way -- arrogant, unresponsive, uncaring.

They care about nothing but their bottom line and their customer service has become non-existent.  They are entirely outsourced with people that really don't understand English and are basically a warm body and nothing more.  After being with Airbnb since 2014 I have finally had enough as a host. Many guests here think they protect the hosts, trust me as a host they do not, not one bit.  Last spring (2020) Chesky said he realized that they basically abandoned their hosts and that would change.  Well, fact is that was simply lip service and they have not changed and have in fact only become much worse.  If they do respond to your request for customer service and that is a big if, they do so with one of those warm bodies, that are completely untrained and clueless. I have suspended my 4 properties from Airbnb after many years and only did so when I felt I had no choice.  I was also one of the hosts they totally screwed over last spring in the beginnings of the Covid crisis who overlooked that and continued to list with them.  Well no more.  I can't see how this company will continue to prosper with their current attitude towards hosts and property owners.

Don't book with them!!","We booked two stays for Christmas, hoping that the COVID situation would improve and that we'd be able to visit my daughter during the holidays in Montana. Because we were going to a very low populated area we felt we could be extremely careful by driving and with social distancing, face masks, and hand washing we'd be as careful and safe as if we were at home. At the time no one in our family had been exposed and we were pretty much quarantining except for my husband who was going to the hospital for cardiac rehab and an occasional grocery store trip. I read the refund policy and honestly didn't think it would be an issue. Then, of course, we found out that my husband was exposed to someone who tested positive and that changed everything. We cancelled our trip, because obviously we would not want to put anyone else at risk. I immediately contacted both hosts who were very kind and understanding, but held us to their cancellation policies. One host returned half of what we paid, and the other host only returned the cleaning pre-payment, which I just felt was ridiculous.  I didn't expect a full refund, half was enough. But to be okay with taking the entire payment under these circumstances? Why doesn't airbnb have an overarching refund policy during this unusual time? I do take issue with that, and the fact that in everything I read on the airbnb website, they seemed to be perfectly okay with it. I did contact the one host and asked if she would reconsider her refund policy based on our situation, and her reply was that if she rebooked the house for the days we were going to be there she would give me a partial refund. But what are the chances that someone else is going to book a stay during Christmas during COVID? Get real. I'm a businesswoman. I get it, COVID has annihilated the travel industry and these small business owners are being hurt tremendously. But this is not how you build customer confidence and trust, especially if you want to have a business after COVID is over. Shame on airbnb for not having a standard refund policy during this time. And shame on those hosts who don't understand what customer service is. This was my first experience with airbnb, and it will be my last. We travel to Bozeman a lot, and now I'll pay more to stay in a hotel so I don't run into this type of experience again. There are a lot of different services out there, and consumers have more options now  than ever before. When COVID is over and people are traveling again, we're going to remember how difficult you made it during these difficult times. Stay well, everyone! And Stay away from airbnb!"

My wife and I booked a trip to San Diego in March of 2020 just before covid went crazy. Once the lockdowns began and the realization came that our upcoming trip was not going to happen we began the airbnb approved cancellation process. The host unbeknownst to us had marked down on his Airbnb calendar that we had completed our stay. Which made the cancellation process now impossible.  Upon reaching out to him he told us that he was doing that so we could easily reschedule at our convenience. We told him that rescheduling was not an option for us at this point and we would like to formally cancel. He has still (7 months) later NOT refunded our money and Airbnb has been unable/unwilling to do anything. They have absolutely NO customer support. If your complaint does not fit into one there 20 or so pre programmed algorithms forget about it. My wife and I have tried countless emails, any phone number we can find and have gotten no where.

Air bnb sent a few alternatives in Gloucester which was of no use whatsoever. We had to book ourselves and pay over the odds for a last min accommodation on a Saturday night. We missed our meal and cut our stay from 3days down to 2 due to the increased costs. Airbnb couldn’t care less. Useless, greedy and I really hope they get regulated at some point.

I reserved a place for July in Maine for about $1153 in February 2020, just before the COVID-19 warnings came out. I asked to postpone my trip as I was promised I could do (with or without pandemic), and they obliged me but tacked on an additional $400, rather arbitrarily, as I put off my reservation to the offseason. They gave me some nonsense about the market price going up, which is total horse pucky, but I paid the difference -- big mistake. They charged me the full 2nd half of what was due back in April 2020 for a rental that wasn't coming about until December 2020. This is not advertised AirBnb policy but they did it anyway. They apologized, but I was still out the money. Yesterday they tacked on another fee for $43 without any explanation other than that it was the new total. No, I said. You got my money back in April and were able to collect interest all this time, while I was out tapping my toes. Give the $43 back or I call it off. They wouldn't give it back, so I canceled.  Since the cancellation policy only allows half of the original price, yes, you guessed it, I was out half the total bill. I asked to speak with someone higher up, no dice, so I'm complaining here so that you avoid the same fate. Do not accept mission creep with the bill. Do not agree to any changes not listed in the original agreements. It doesn't pay. And maybe think about not using AirBnb at all since it's poorly run where customer support is concerned."

The owner lied to Airb&b, telling them that the prostitutes were far away from us so... OK! We had an argument in chat with on of their people. The owner gave us all our money back even though she maintained that she did nothing wrong to airb&b (that wanted give us nothing even though I send them pictures and videos) second booking after that was a tiny smelly apartment. Again, photos were completely false, the house was on someone else garden... A nightmare. I beg you not to rent with this people, airb&b are awful, you can report problems in the first 24 hours but they don't care. They won't give you money and the houses are disgusting. Avoid. ALSO both honest we're marked as superhost. Know that fake reviews are possible I am not surprised."

Now after the lockdown we are in tier 3, tried to rearrange the date, but host refused to change. Airbnb were useless and blamed us for booking after the 14th March and therefore no refunds would be given. Appalling customer service and inflexibility.... they have kept over £300 deposit, thanks Airbnb for being so understanding!!!!!!!"

Donated $500,000 to the Marxist hate group Black Lives Matter and to the NAACP and encourages others to donate as well. On July 7th, Airbnb encourages guests to only spend money at black-owned businesses, thus discriminating against businesses owned by people of other skin pigmentations. Use a hotel instead. For cheap stays, we recommend Motel 6."
1438,Olivia A,US,1 review,"Friday, December 4, 2020, 04:59:39 PM",1,False advertisement and abysmal customer service,"I am disheartened and appalled by my most recent experience with Airbnb. Looking back, I have been an avid user of Airbnb along with my friends and family, and up until now, I've never had an experience that was anything less than fantastic. My most recent experience cost me over $1,000, hours of my time, added travel, and unnecessary stress at a time when stress is paramount given the current pandemic. The listing I booked was falsely advertised and reeked horribly of cigarette smoke, but this wasn't the worst part. The worst part is that Airbnb offered me no refund (aside from a measly service fee), and made me feel as though this was somehow my fault. The ""2-bedroom"" listing was in fact a one bedroom, with the tiny bedroom closet converted into a 2nd bedroom. The property was listed as an ""entire home"" and ""bungalow"" when it was a mother in law suite in the main house, and was connected by a door. (We are in the middle of an airborne pandemic. We never would have booked this listing if we knew it was apart of another home). And worst of all, the powerful odor of cigarette smoke filled the entire property, even with the air purifier running and us opening all of the windows for over an hour. One of my guests who attended the stay with me has severe asthma, so this was not only an enormous irritation for the rest of us, it was a severe health issue for her. After nearly two hours of trying to make the listing work, we realized the issue was unresolvable. The host was not going to be able to erect a standalone property as advertised, build a second bedroom as advertised, or remove what was clearly years of smoke damage. We were forced to find another listing last minute. The only listing available was in Santa Cruz, meaning that I had to spend another almost $1,000, travel over an hour to get to the new listing (after traveling over 3 hours to get to the first one), and scramble to try and save our vacation. When we visited the help page, we were instructed through Airbnb chat services to submit a refund request to the host to remedy the issue, which we did within the required 24 hour time period. Now, I am told that there is nothing they can do aside from refund me the $20 service fee. The listing cost over $1,300. I am outraged and in disbelief at this lack of customer service. Let me be clear that I own my own part-time business, I work full-time in public affairs, and the bulk of my work experience is in customer service. I have never in my life encountered or been instructed to provide such a poor customer experience. Not only did Airbnb side with a host that's falsely advertising a property and subjecting guests to health risks, they did nothing to rectify the issue. At a time when we really needed a vacation given the state of our world, we were instead left penniless and without recourse. Airbnb - you are a multi-million dollar company with infinite resources, and you had every opportunity to make this right. Shame on you."

I am a hotel owner and operator and have allowed for refunds of individual and group business, last minute wedding cancellations and non-refundable pre-paid reservations since March all with no cost to our guests. All of the major brands, even Expedia has done the same thing because it's the right thing to do during a worldwide health crisis. But TurnKey is evening keeping service fees while providing no service. I will be losing this message everywhere I can. Please don't use TURNKEY as a guest or as your rental agent.

1446,Abigail Baker,US,2 reviews,"Monday, November 30, 2020, 03:12:10 PM",1,Airbnb will take your money and you'll…,"Airbnb will take your money and you'll have to spend 24 hours a day trying to get it back and more than likely have to sue a host or Airbnb. When things go wrong you'll have nowhere to go and then pay double to cover what you paid for your Airbnb and new lodgings. Here's my story.Even though Ana was an attentive host in the beginning, she dropped the hammer when it came to my noise complaint. She basically said that I was a light sleeper and that the refund policy is strict. I did feel that this was in bad taste. I don’t expect a full refund but I did want to check out early (I reported the noise and damages within 24 hours) and not stay the month that cost over 2k. I was disappointed in this since I approached the matter with kindness and gratitude for her attentiveness.I lived in the downtown Chicago area for 15 years and came back for work and had to stay a month. This is the loudest building I’ve ever encountered in all my years of living in Chicago. I hate leaving negative reviews but the listing description was inaccurate and Ana was extremely condescending and blamed me for not reading it. Since Airbnb looks out only for hosts, what’s in the listing is the golden rule (you will be held to this very strictly), here’s what’s different from the posting:The listing was actually a studio, not a one bedroom.The listing says and I quote, “Due to the apartment’s prime location, you may encounter some city noise, nearby train.” That’s all it says. I’ve taken time to outline what this really looks like below.No CO2 detector as indicated. The smoke detector also did not appear to work (I saw no blinking lights) and it was loosely hanging by wires.TV remotes didn’t work.Dirty walls with holes and splash marks and dirty downstairs area with trash everywhereNo ethernet as promised or indoor fireplace as listed.No dedicated workspace as listed. There are two pop up countertop areas and one was broken. The other was not a “dedicated work area.” I tried to setup a workstation there but could not.Here is the truth about the noise.There are MULTIPLE trains that run right past the building all day every day. The orange line, green line, and red line (underground). You hear every train announcement and the screeching and rattling. There are also multiple sets of tracks. Don’t forget the Metra train whistle that you can also hear. It basically sounds like you are living at the train station. You also have the regular street noise which includes, people shouting (and cursing), music, car mufflers, buses, horns, and sirens. I can even hear people skateboarding down the sidewalk. Roosevelt is an extremely busy street that connects to Michigan avenue. It’s like staying next to an expressway.The building in itself has noise and the lobby area is pretty run down. I heard loud music blasting at late hours and other hours in the day. There is also the sound of screeching chairs and the smell of marijuana that comes into the unit.I work from home so I had to spend a lot of time in the unit. If you are coming to site see (which you currently can’t because of COVID) and won’t be home often then it could work. I myself had to sleep with noise-canceling headphones and constantly spray because of the smells wafting in. To top it all off, Ana basically accused me of vandalizing the unit and insisted that there was no damage before I got there. I had been there less than 24 hours when I sent her and Airbnb corp photos of the holes, scratches, and damaged smoke and CO2 detectors on top of the noise complaints. Learned my lesson. Report any and all damage right away. Because when issues start popping up people will look for any way they can to make you pay the price. She also kept apologizing that I didn’t understand the listing and sent me screenshots of all of the good reviews. She then told me that her husband was a lawyer if I needed one. I was forced to leave the property because there were no working smoke or CO2 detectors and the noise. Airbnb customer service just said well she did offer to fix it and expected me to continue to stay there and put my health and safety at risk. The Better Business Bureau posted this on May 7, 2020. The company advised BBB the following:Airbnb is experiencing massive layoffs, therefore complaints at this time are no longer being responded to. We do not have a timeline as to if and when a response will happen again in the near future. So at this time, any outstanding complaints will go unanswered. BBB will continue to process complaints against Airbnb. Consumers may also reach out to the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office, Consumer Mediation at (415) 551-9595."

The property was not COVID cleaned.The so called Super Host says he uses a professional cleaner. I dispute this. There were rusty oven pans, filthy stained tea towels and an oven glove that was a health hazard all by itself. The owner says he is saving the planet by not removing these items. The kitchen and shower were not clean. The owner also sent me several abusive messages when I flagged up the issues. We are in a pandemic. We were stuck as our bathroom was out of action hence the need to be in an Airbnb. No help or support from this very large company. These properties are not regulated which was a huge shock to me. On further research the host has left very abusive reviews about other guests when they have found issues. Never again would I trust an Airbnb property."

It was advertised as “Big Flat with amazing views and public parking”. Our plans changed in April and I notified Esther, the owner right away on April 5th. Esther got back to me very upset because the reason I had for my cancellation didn't seem good enough for her to return our money. Even though there were still 3 months left. When I read the cancellation policy it seemed to me that as long as I cancelled 14 or more before date of entry I would get my money back. Apparently that and within less than 48 hours of initial payment which to me it wasn’t clear.I spoke to Airbnb and they weren’t that helpful. Airbnb finally gave me half of thei commission, $163.33 on May 22nd.I offer to keep the rental if she couldn’t rent it for my dates but Esther didn’t accept that, even though it was already rented again by the end of May.Esther kept my $1575.76 and also received the new renters money.Airbnb kept my $163.33 and received a full commission from new renters.Never again will I choose Airbnb!Beware of Esther the owner of this 4 bedroom flat in Azpeitia.

Another time they said we should have alerted the guest the charge before next guest checks in. We had 5 hours to get someone over there from the time they checked out to new guest checking in and provide estimate for a sliding shower door that was shattered. We had a guest complain it was 78 degrees inside when it was 50 degrees outside. We suggested turning one of the three ceiling fans or one of the three floor fans on. Didn’t matter. Airbnb let them leave after they showered, baked food and hung out there for 10 hours. Full refund for them. They let guests out of their reservations and refund their money EVERY TIME! Don’t trust them! I have lost all faith in Airbnb and have decided to cancel all my future bookings and sell my properties. I have SO MANY MORE stories, but I’m sure they’ll still find a loop hole to stay in business. Side note ... I have 100+ 5-star reviews and I’m a Superhost.

1470,John Y,US,1 review,"Wednesday, November 18, 2020, 10:17:13 AM",1,DO NOT TRUST! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!,"DO NOT TRUST!! This explains exactly what most people have experienced with this company. DO NOT TRUST THEM!! for your accommodation needs. I had booked a reservation with them and I had not received an agreement and terms and conditions about the cancellation policy, you basically have to investigate and get it yourself, but before I booked it, I was surely inclined about most cancellation policies that I'm aware of, in my wildest dreams I have never thought you could not get a 100% refund after canceling within 72 hours, after that you get only 50%! I booked it during the pandemic, so I was uneasy about the reservation but I had booked it at least 6 months in advance. Cancelling my reservation would definitely not hurt the business or the host. I still could not get a refund. It was very unclear and misleading even when you have read their terms and conditions! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
1471,Rhea,US,2 reviews,"Wednesday, November 18, 2020, 02:59:24 AM",1,I will never again use Airbnb!!! 2 horrible experiences out of 3.,"I had a very negative experience the first time I used Airbnb as a guest. However, this was over 1 year ago so I decided to give it another shot. I booked a house for 30 days-extended stay, and it was wonderful: clean, private, and the owners left a welcome gift. Absolutely amazing! (I did pay a significant amount of money for it, but I was looking for cleanliness and comfort in the middle of the pandemic). After this, I wasn't able to book the same place for another 30 days so I had to look for another place. I decided to continue using Airbnb since this experience had been perfect (I also paid a significant amount of money for the second place, it wasn't one of the cheaper properties). As soon as I arrived to the new place (which had good reviews) I realized I had made a huge mistake. The home looked great on the pictures but once I actually got there, I felt scared and very unsafe. It was located in a very bad and old part of town. However, I didn't want to immediately be negative, so I decided to just brush it off, hoping the inside of the house was better. As soon as I opened the door I realized that the place was dirty, there were dead mosquitos on the windows and wall, the furniture was barely functional and dirty, the place had a very strong smell of perfume mixed in with a smell of humidity in an old and not well ventilated home. I immediately felt dizzy. I walked to the bathtub and there was still hair from someone else, I'm assuming the previous guests. Later on I also realized the refrigerator wasn't working property (and this was supposed to be an extended stay during the pandemic). It was old, smelled bad, not properly cleaned (in the time of covid) and the furniture was in really bad shape. I immediately contacted customer support and after trying to fight this for several days, I finally gave up and understood that Airbnbn would do anything to keep my money even if this was a very unfair situation and had completely ruined all my travel plans. 2 horrible experiences out of 3. What angered me the most is not that I had to stay at a property where I was constantly completely grossed out but that Airbnb made no effort to apologize, offer me at least a partial refund or credit for the large sum of money I paid to end up staying in a really bad neighborhood and an old, dirty and plainly disgusting home. Airbnb only cared about keeping my money, not about keeping my business or being fair. Huge waste of money and time I was planning on using to relax a little bit. I will simply never again use Airbnb and have already told all my friends and family about this horrible experience so they don't have to go through the same thing. Please think twice before using Airbnb as a guest, there's other options out there. It's simply not worth the stress and the terrible customer service."

At first as a guest it was a new and great idea until they began adding fees and raising the percentages that they earn.

1476,Virgil Solozzo,US,1 review,"Monday, November 16, 2020, 07:45:58 PM",1,You may well find something decent but…,"You may well find something decent but I will never use this system again for a few practical reasons. First, you are basically pressured into reserving a place ASAP, after which you have 48 hours to cancel and receive a full refund. Rentals have different policies, but generally, you're on the hook for 50% of your stay once 48 hours elapses, and 100% once you're within 7 days of your trip. Some hosts are even stricter than that. In contrast, most hotels offer free and easy cancellation up to 24-48 hours prior to your stay.Once you reserve, it opens a window for dialog with the host of the property. You better ask a million questions at this point, because this is within the time period where you can still cancel for free. Hopefully the host is responsive (and honest) - you only have 48 hours. And I've had a few hosts outright decline to rent to me because I ask too many questions. Hmmm. Next pitfall: Once you feel comfortable and decide to keep your reservation, you have to wait until a few days before your stay to receive the instructions and additional info that you wished you knew sooner. Little things the host can (and usually does) throw in like telling you the internet hasn't been working lately, or the hot tub was recently broken by a guest and is awaiting repair, or the fact that the AC stopped working last night and will be repaired the day after you check out. You have no recourse for a refund (and no time to book something else) - AirBnb's customer service is atrocious and unhelpful. Next pitfall - now that you've had a sub-par experience in a place that didn't live up to your expectations, you have a window to write a review telling the world about it. But guess what: your host also has a window to make a damage claim against your credit card on file. This host already has left a bad taste in your mouth, and holds the keys to your credit card, so do you rock the boat with a bad review, or do you just want to cut your losses? You'll either leave a good review, or no review, just to put the whole thing to bed without further incident. These hosts end up with mostly positive reviews as a result. I've had 3 experiences with this crap service. Twice I was duped into a 5 star super host home only to have the place fall well short on both occasions (all of the examples of things that could go wrong DID go wrong for me). The other time, I rented a private house only to find out a week before my stay that the house would actually be shared with another family. I had to cancel and fight with AirBnb for two months to have my money refunded. Hotels have very transparent cancellation policies and are very forthcoming when you ask questions before you book. There is little to no harm in writing a poor review if the hotel deserves one. In fact, on at least two occasions, I received a full refund from hotel managers that were apologetic after reading my review. As I said in the beginning, you may find a diamond in the rough, but my experiences have all been negative. 3 pitches, 3 strikes. No more AirBnb for me. Caveat emptor."

The host's cancellation policy at the time stated that only 50% of the full amount minus the first night and service fee would be refunded if I cancelled on or after 28 October. Fair enough, I thought. Hosts need to spend time and money to prepare their places for their guests. I went ahead with the booking.On 31 October, the UK's prime minister announced that the country would enter a four-week nationwide lockdown on 5 November. All non-essential businesses were required to close, including those in the hospitality sector.  To fully comply with the law, I asked my host if he would cancel my stay at no cost to me. He replied that the cancellation policy at the time of booking stands, without addressing the fact that the UK national law had changed to render my stay illegal. I asked AirBnb support to mediate.AirBnb support sided with the host, stating that their COVID refund policy only applies to bookings made on or before 14 March, which is the date the global pandemic was announced. Under this contrived excuse, AirBnb refused to acknowledge that my stay was recently rendered illegal by UK law, and summarily refused to refund the majority of my money.As a result of AirBnb's disregard for local lockdowns, I have been forced to pay £523.78 out of the full £908.63 trip fee, for refusing to attend a trip that was made ILLEGAL. I'm genuinely curious to hear how AirBnb could justify that the host deserves to get this money, in an intellectually honest manner, without quoting an outdated policy that disregards ongoing changes in the law. It is understandable that the host should not stand to lose any money that he spent in preparing for my scheduled arrival, but this could not have possibly costed him £523.78. That's more than half of the total amount payable for my two-week stay.I'm a guest with one review, albeit a positive one. My host has 1381 reviews. As a business intent on making money, it's clear who you would prefer to side with in a conflict. I'm just writing this in the hope that someone at AirBnb with a conscience will end up reading it, recognise the sheer absurdity of the decision, and take action to prevent this from happening to other travellers in the future.If anyone is considering an alternative to AirBnb, know that you can book vacation homes on TripAdvisor as well."

Airbnb was not available for weeks, you only have overwhelmed and completely unsuspecting, incompetent employees on the phone or you are handled with standard emails without reference to the problem or reality.It's a cheek how incompetent and condescending Airbnb treats its hosts. As a host, I was left with the financial damage caused by the deactivation of my accommodations. No help or anything else comes from Airbnb. I can fool myself too!Dear hosts, before you advertise your accommodation on Airbnb, please take a close look at the reviews of other hosts.Even in the event of damage, you will probably be fobbed off by Airbnb and left alone, as many reviews from former hosts show here.

Coming into the stay we had a note listing all chores we needed to do in the house and if they weren’t completed then there would be a price which i found very uncomfortable. it also stated our check out was at 11 am. We had no hot water in the shower and sinks. Till the end of our stay one of the bathrooms still didn’t have hot water. In the master bedroom bath one of the shower heads didn’t work. The main reason why we chose to stay in this place was for the pool. the pool and jacuzzi was ice cold. we were willing to pay the additional charged and asked for the heater to be put on; it was NEVER PUT ON. With that being said we couldn’t even enjoy the pool. During our stay there were people blasting music and working on a roof before 8am. i have a one year old sleeping so that is very disrespectful to my family. lastly as stated before we received a note stating our check out was at 11. At 9:30am we had someone in the backyard power hosing the side of the side of the house AGAIN where my child was sleeping. When we approached the person they said our check out was 10. We called the property manager and they said that was an old note... if that’s the case why would that note be posted in different places. If that was the case then everything on that list is invalid. This stay was the most uncomfortable and most annoying stay. I reached out to air bnb customer support and they basically didn’t care and refunded me only 70 out of the 500 i spent. when i told them i didn’t feel it wasn’t good enough and i wanted the number to a manger or corporate they stopped responding. i also wrote a horrible review on the property itself and air bnb removed it. i find it strange that only the good reviews are listed but not the negative ones.

Air B and B now wish to treat us like children by threatening all of us that if we don’t sign up to and agree to their cleaning policies and other COVID related policies they will remove our listings. Speaking as a retired lawyer that understands contract law, believe me when I say that agreeing to all of this puts even more contractual obligations upon all hosts that could easily be challenged by admittedly not very often, unscrupulous guests then seeking unreasonable refunds and/or compensation. I could provide many examples of how this could arise. On the basis of this, we shall not be signing up to the new rules and if our accommodations are removed, and we hope not,  then so be it, there are other platforms . I am confident that by now I fully understand the principles of social distancing, cross contamination on hand contact points,  along with the importance of scrupulous cleaning etc. Hosts, you might like to consider carefully before you sign up ... cancellation policies are stacked against you and this is just one more way you could be forced to refund or have sanctions against you. Air B and B will of course say that they are behaving responsibly towards their guests but if they don’t trust their  hosts to behave responsibly, especially those who have been with them  for some time like us (super hosts) then whose interests do they truly  have at heart? I’ve just amended this post to suggest why don’t Air B and B offer some kind of online training sessions for new hosts .. would this work perhaps?"

Because of this my family celebrates Thanksgiving the Sunday following. At the end of October I find a nice big rental through Airbnb and we have a family meal together. It’s our tradition.Or shall I say it WAS our tradition.While attempting to book, I continually hit an error saying that due to COVID and their enforcement of no parties policy, my booking couldn’t be processed. Our family consists of 4 adults, 2 kids and 2 infants. So not really a “partying” group.We reached out to the owner of the property (this is someone we have booked with before) and explained. She attempted to approve our reservation, this failed. We called Airbnb CS and were told that due to our “immediate reservation” (I’m not sure what their definition of immediate is, but mine isn’t a month) and our short stay as well as a booking in the same city we reside in, we are tagged as probable partiers. We were informed that this could not be overridden.However, the kindly agent said, there are other options for renting which we could find in our suggested stays area of our Airbnb profile.We hung up unsettled. But we did check out what was suggested. Which was single room stays and hotels...No thank you Airbnb 👎🏻😒😒😒We’ll create a new tradition which doesn’t involve booking through your service. EVER. AGAIN."

The owner of the property says we can cancel and get a 50% minus service fee, but not the full amount because she will lose her income...Well poor you with your mansion and 5 holiday cottages earning 10 times what I earn in a month. They also refuse to change the dates because we would stop someone else booking that same date at a later time. Their customer service is absolutely pointless and they just repeat themselves and don't answer your question. Now they have ignored us on all platforms.What has happened to humanity during this pandemic where money comes with treating people with respect???"

While all businesses and companies I dealt with are making COVID exceptions when positive test proof is presented. Stay away from booking with airbnb as they lack sympathy and reasoning.

We were a party of 4 with a 6yo child.  On arrival at the property, we found that it was filthy dirty, stuff left in drawers and cupboards, loose steps, filthy cooker and kettle, medicines left in drawers (easily within reach of the child) Loose and dangerous steps etc etc.  We left the property and stayed at an hotel.  The owner refused a refund, and AirBnb were not at all helpful and eventually refused a refund.  Their argument was that we left the property before giving the owner a chance to clean it.  Well it would have taken many hours of work to bring this place up to standard.  I am now left over £400 out of pocket and the host has my money for providing a dangerous and shoddy property to guests.  I will never ever again use AirBnb"

As soon as I walked on the porch there were beeps and they intensified as I got closer to the door. DEAD GIVEAWAY!! When I entered the Air BNB and notified my friend. The information listed mention NOTHING about monitoring. My friend received a phone call saying that he saw three people and that we should be on the third. Once again THERE WAS NO MENTION OF CAMERAS IN THE LISTING of course that has changed since then. We felt it was best to leave because we were being recorded or watched without prior knowledge or permission. His attitude was very rude and he continued to try to communicate with my friend afterward she canceled the Air BNB."

Suddenly without warning my account was deactivated. I had no way to get in touch with them other than via Facebook messenger, it took from July to November for them to tell me that I had apparently violated the terms, no explanation of how I had done this or what had occurred!Having looked at the internet it seems this is a regular occurrence for both hosts and customers!

1520,Alison,GB,9 reviews,"Monday, November 2, 2020, 04:27:07 PM",1,Happy to take your money for Illegal New York Listings,"I gather from the number of poor reviews on here that AirBnB does not care about Trust Pilot reviews... but oh well here we go....We booked in March a stay at a New York Manhattan apartment advertised as 'entire place' arriving November this year. When looking into a separate issue we discovered that in New York it is illegal under the Multiple Dwellings Law to let short term rentals to holiday goers. Information regarding this can be found the New York City government website of special enforcement.Please note in some cases rentals may be legal, but these are more townhouses in Brooklyn Area and not the apartment we have book in Manhattan! New York has very strict laws regarding rentals in the city to protect the locals living there. Even if the listing was legal there are rules that you can only have maximum of 2 paying guests (our booking has 5 paying guests so against the law) and also every person must have full access to the whole apartment and the host has to be staying there with us. We were sold a private ‘entire place’ so even if the listing is legal they are breaking the law by having 5 paying guests and AirBnB has mis-sold us the booking as the host must be present during the stay. If the host is present during the stay it is not private and also that means for safety in following the NYC laws he has to have access to our areas and we have access to his areas.. how is that safe??This information above is if the listing is legal, which we have proven ours is not legal in the Certificate of Occupancy provided to AirBnB that our apartment we have rented is in a class A building meaning it is illegal to rent as a short term holiday letting as per the Multiple Dwellings Law. The same building is renting multiple apartments and we email the real estate agent who also confirms that AirBnB is strictly NOT ALLOWED. You can prove all this as everything is public records including the certificate of occupancy proving the class of the building and that it is an illegal listing which can be found here bisweb.nyc.gov website.AirBnB loves to play games with its clients. Its own website flaunts that their whole business is based on the trust of host and guests yet when a customer raises a concern about the legality of their booking they love to ignore you, when they do reply they send you round in circles. Our case has now been escalated to the legal department of AirBnB and the latest update is that it is awaiting to be assigned to an agent and has been waiting now over a week to be assigned. Our booking goes in less than 19 days and we first raise this issue to AirBnB on the 13th Oct… it took hours of messaging and emails and phone calls everyday to even get our issue raised with the correct department. You get no straight answers from the Customer Service Ambassadors and when we asked if it will even be looked into before we depart… AirBnB confirmed they cannot say if they will get back to us before we arrive and so are happy to send customers to illegal apartments with no reassurance that it follows local NYC laws and safety procedures. AirBnB is a company that loves to take and hang on customers money to earn loads of interest from it and happily sends customers in to dangerous and illegal situations. They are happy for us in their not replying and ignoring us that we go to New York and could have the department of special enforcement waiting for us on the doorstep."

We were due to stay at Jacqui’s property at the end of October. Due to circumstances beyond our control, our home town was put into tier 3 a few days before we were meant to stay in the Lakes which meant we had to cancel our trip. We told Jacqui that there was nothing we could do to prevent this and would like a refund. Unlike many of our friends in a similar position who were given an immediate refund/chance to change their booking, we were refused any refund whatsoever (including a cleaning fee!!) because as she stated “This information is only advice and guidance which means the guest did have a choice as to whether to take the cottage.” She has stopped returning our messages and has kept £350 of our money. I’m quite shocked that such a reputable company let people like this get away with taking people’s money and not even offering to change the booking or give any kind of refund as a result of something beyond the customers’ control. She has a property in Durham also, so please be aware. She is a “super host” with no understanding of how to deal with customers. Awful"

I have been in touch with AirBnb and they refuse to refund the coupon.The thing is, coupons not being refunded is NOT in their Terms and Conditions. At the time of booking, all that was said was that my trip was ""fully refundable"" until the date specified. Pointing to some random article on their site (which is was CS did in response to my request) does NOT form part of the contract. It must be stated up-front at the time of booking. You cannot hide terms on your website. They must be made clear. This is a very basic contract law requirement.The coupon may be for a small amount, but out of principle alone I will not use AirBnb again."

I honestly thought I was working with a robot. I am a property owner, and rent our cabin out to guests. We have had a death, stroke and rehab in the family all in the last month. Yahoo 2020! It is more than we can take. Renting your property out, even using sites like Airbnb, is very time-consuming. I tried to open a ticket, talk to a representative, call and email. I started cancelling bookings from the farthest out. I first informed the guest that we were sorry, and we had to cancel their booking. I was working on February bookings. They started replying to me; they could not cancel it without getting charged a cancellation fee. I told them, I will cancel it for you. When I went to cancel, it charged me a $50.00 cancellation fee, for a booking four months out. (There are over 100 bookings)Finally, someone responded to my email; they told me I would need a death certificate and must get it to them within 48 hours, or they wouldn't waive the fees. They told me that I had to continue to cancel them. I sent them all of the necessary documentation.  I went back to cancel the bookings, Airbnb won't allow me to cancel anymore; I am over my allowed amount. Airbnb told me to send them all of the names and booking numbers; I did. I explained to them how time-sensitive and extremely important, this is for both the owners and the guest. It is the holidays, and it's going to be hard for them to find other rentals. Like a ROBOT she responded with, we cant cancel anything past November 11th, and she just started cancelling bookings coming up in the next few days; and without even explanation. It's as if they don't read anything I write. I can't describe the damage that their lack of customer service has caused so many people. Right now I sit with over 100 bookings; the guest can't cancel, I can't cancel, Airbnb said they couldn't cancel it. I was told that a supervisor would get back with me between 48 - 72 hours. I have recently had a stroke; the only thing I am told to do in life right now is not to be stressed!"

When there was no replacement accommodation, I booked another accommodation to replace it so I wouldn’t be left out at the mercy of the weather with my belongings.A few days later, AirBNB called me and said I should try to resolve the disagreement with the host and since I canceled the second night myself so, I am not entitled to a refund for the second night.

I tried to cancel my November reservation in June with Evolve Vacation Rental and Airbnb with no luck because the COVID rules did not apply to my reservation. I was informed to keep checking back for COVID updates on cancellations which were updated twice a month. Phone calls are not accepted unless it is within 3 days of the reservation. After numerous message communications back and forth, I finally received a phone call from an Airbnb representative that stated upper management would contact me to discuss my circumstances. I am at the deadline to receive only 50% of my monies and I have not received any follow-up communications. I believe that Airbnb and Evolve Vacation Rentals are using COVID as a means to take monies from people that are affected by this COVID pandemic and are doing a disservice to their customers and hosts."

I informed the guests who were willing to ignore the rules, I cannot when I know this consciously turn a blind eye and be a responsible host like Airbnb require. Seeing as I have instant book, I am told I am allowed to cancel 3 bookings a year as the host if I for example feel uncomfortable, I have cancelled one this year so should have been able to cancel 2 more times penalty free. My guests didn't want to cancel and lose their money so I did it via a message with Airbnb. This incurred the penalties including a £50 fine, an automated bad review and my calendar was blocked for the dates I had cancelled. When I questioned this after much stress and worry on part Airbnb said that instant book meant I could cancel and then they decide if it's ok on a case by case basis and that actually you can only cancel 1 booking per year. I sent screen shots to my case advisor of Airbnbs own policy, still I was told the decision was final. I turned off Instant Book and then Airbnb kept trying to persuade me step by step through the process of the 'perks' of being able to cancel 3 times a year ect. Then the next day Airbnb sent me a quiz which would tell me again about the false perks of instant book for hosts. I contacted Airbnb on twitter where they were desperate to get me to only converse via DM's. I found a post from another host asking what would happen in the situation I had found myself in and Airbnbs response was that host and guest should mutually cancel and that no penalties would be given, I highlighted this but still nothing. I think this is a shocking way to be treating hosts who bring income to Airbnb. It's a worrying way to run any business. If you makes policies and ask people to agree to them, you should honour them. You should not as a worldwide business be making your hosts choose between following the law or facing penalties on their income. I lost the income from the 2 bookings and have to now fork out £50 on top of that for each booking. I cannot recoup by having new bookings on 2 weekends because my calender is blocked. I think this can only get worse going forward. What will happen if my area goes into tier 3? I would love some answers. Currently I am not even being replied to from Airbnb."

Fortunately, there are enough alternatives so try to avoid it as often as you can.In February 2020 we booked an apartment in New York. The trip did not happen because the airlines cancelled the flights. Airbnb compensated the expenses by issuing a coupon. You might think that this is great but wait a second.We used the coupon to get a discount for our next trip. However, that trip also had to be cancelled. We got the money back but the coupon was gone. Apparently if you cancel your reservation you loose the coupon(s) that you used for the payment. The rule is stated in ""small letters"" on a page, which is very difficult to find. It is counterintuitive and unfair.The customer service is bad and difficult to reach."
1545,Ghattas,US,2 reviews,"Friday, October 23, 2020, 01:31:24 PM",1,UNSAFE and Unprofessional,"My partner and I booked a place on Airbnb ealry March before COVID-19 for November 2020. We had booked this place for guests that were coming from abroad. My partner did the booking under her account. Come October, the people who were coming are no longer traveling due to the COVID pandemic. On top of this, the people who are running the  place were very unresponsive and unprofessional, telling us that they will call back and never do and then go as far as saying that they contacted the other partner when they did not. The final straw for this location was when a most recent review of the place claimed that the place was UNINHABITABLE and that they got their full refund. We contacted Airbnb to get a full refund and of course we had to call 4 times between dealing with incompetent customer service individuals, or having the line ""mysteriously"" get cut off. After finally getting through to explain all of the above issues, here was their conclusion: 1- since the booking is under my partner's name, then they cannot give a full refund based on the COVID-19 policy since it is our guests who are not coming (because it makes sense that we booked a 9 room airbnb for only herself right?). On top of this,  they are requesting that travelers have official restrictions from the US government knowing that most countries don't have that entry restriction. 2- They did not even address the bad communication and unprofessional behavior of the managers of the location. 3- When it came to the UNINHABITABLE review of the location they said that we need to have proof of it and since it is someone else's experience they wont do anything about it.Airbnb did not do ANYTHING about a review saying that the place was uninhabitable during a pandemic. They basically wanted us to go there and get pictures on our own booked time. So they want to put us at risk, take the trip to a location that is possibly UNSAFE to be in in order to get a refund. You would expect a more thorough investigation over a possible health hazard like this. Airbnb is just a third party money making machine that holds no accountability to the places that they allow on their websites. BE careful booking with this place."

I made a reservation for quarantine, but when I read the review, I found that the cleanliness and safety conditions were poor, such as dust and hair and cockroaches. I decided not to stay in Elly house, so I contacted the host several times and asked for a full refund, but there was no reply, so I sent a message through Airbnb. I took prompt action.When I searched for a place, if I was able to see recent reviews, I would never have booked this place. When I clicked on Elly House, the reviews on the main page didn't look too bad, but every review was old, so I was a little bit skeptical, but I made a reservation. After that, I clicked on the host to see a little bit about the host,  and then I was able to see the latest reviews. I don't know why he set it up like that, but usually, people who search for accommodations, they make decisions based on reviews on the main page.  You wouldn't think there would be other bad reviews hidden in it when you click on a hostname. I read bed reviews regarding cleanness and safety. I booked Elly house for quarantine, not just for a regular stay. I was really concerned about this. Besides, Elly house has been used for quarantine, so especially in the COVID19 situation, cleaning conditions should be taken seriously . I asked for a full refund politely, I tried to reach out to the host in 6hours after I booked the place and asked for a refund. Also, I reached out to AirBnB, but they kept saying that when I get there if there are cleanness and safety issues, then they can give me a full refund. I told them, this is not a normal situation. we are in the COVID19 situation, that's more for a normal situation, but if guests find out there are issues from the late reviews and they are really concern about the situation and especially, the guest was trying to reach out in 6hours, you guys should take this concern seriously and give the guest a refund so that she can find a better place for quarantine.We are living in a COVID19 situation, Airbnb should be more flexible and understandable about this kind of issue."

We traveled 7 hours.  There was no phone service. There was no Internet. No towers.  To get the services you had to travel an hour and a half one-way.The home we rented was absolutely disgusting. The septic tank was backing up into the house. There was  dog poop everywhere. The house smelled like poop. Mold in the showers. It smelled like dog Pee. Everything we used we had to clean. Fridge, stove etc. It was a 7 hour drive for a family vacation. The floors were so dirty that our white socks were black and our bare feet were black. I could go on and on for days. We could not get our deposit back becauseThe host said we had an extra car. The host told us we could just park the other cars down the road away from the neighbors so we did. Because of this they would not give us back our deposit. And because of the way the house was we were supposed to via Airbnb’s policy call or email them within 24 hours with our issues or we could not get our deposit back. We had no way of contacting them in less we drove three hours round-trip. The host did come fix the septic but we had to take care of everything else. I have videos and pictures to show the conditions. Again it didn’t matter to AirBNB. We had to notify them with in 24 hours . With no service to do so. I will never use Airbnb again. Beware.

This was changed with the host who was helpful. Host told me it had been changed. Received a notification days before the original last payment was due to remind me of payment coming out so I contacted the host who had advised me that she couldn’t change it through Airbnb due to it being over a year away but that she has amended on her calendar so reassured me.She advised she had contacted Airbnb to let them know this so they wouldn’t take payment as it would not need to be paid for another year due to the date change. On the day of payment, ofcourse air bnb had taken payment when advised of the date change and to cut a long story short, they are saying I advised them on the day of payment which is incorrect. Seems there was a miscommunication with the host and Airbnb which has resulted in me as the customer having this payment taken from my account a year early and the resolutions team are saying they cannot refund the money, just gave me a token payout of £25 as they are saying the date change is cheaper. This is not acceptable. In this current climate with obviously everyone struggling financially, I feel this could’ve  been rectified by refunding the payment and changing the date until nearer the time next year. I would cancel and rebook elsewhere if I would get a full refund but I know that will not be the case and I would end up losing money. There is no number to call, their email address wasn’t easy to find, the host was just as disappointed in them as I was, she was very helpful and understood why I wouldn’t want to pay now in the current climate when I can pay next year nearer the time and also had trouble getting a prompt reply from them too. Now I’m a very unhappy customer who feels unlistened to and I will never recommend or use them again. It’s a shame as this is meant to be a nice experience with it being for the night before my wedding which has already had to be changed because of covid this just tops the experience for me."

Lies, that was a complete infestation. The final stay.. I paid $217 a night & the owner said check in after 7pm they have a wonderful cleaning lady that likes to clean with a white glove. However, that a damn lie.. There were huge roaches in the bathroom, kitchen & the couch was infested. There was food, candy & champagne corks under the couch. The place had not been cleaned they charged over $200 a night & I still had to check out because of roaches. These homes are not fumigated & ready for guest.

My host reviews have been 4 or 5 star 100% of the time. Even so, Airbnb chose to support a terrible guest who had been listed with them for two years (and had no reviews) over me. Not only did they support her, but they were rude and threatening to me.Sally did a same day instant booking at 10:30 AM for a one night stay. Late in the afternoon she sent an image text that was blank. I sent a text back telling her that there wasn’t an image, and around 7:00 that evening she said it was her service dog information. They had already checked in. We have a strict no animals policy. Our cabins are new, and we want to keep them dander free for the comfort of guests with allergies. One of those guests is my own daughter.  Furthermore, our area had lodging options that accepted animals, so they didn’t need to ignore our no animal policy in order to find lodging. Sally also never provided any evidence that her dog was actually a service dog. I believe this is a scam she has been pulling wherever she travels.After they checked out, I found short black hairs from her black lab everywhere. I had to wash all of the fabric, including the curtains. I also had to clean the floor over and over again. I finally thought I had gotten all of the hair out of the cabin, but when I opened the fridge there were short black hairs on the shelves inside. I posted a review of her stay with information about the condition of the cabin and a private remark that we were disappointed that they wouldn’t respect our wish to keep our new cabins dander and animal hair free.   Sally complained to Airbnb about my review (which I had posted mostly to protect other hosts from Sally). They removed my review and sent me a threatening email that they could remove my account for being discriminatory.  I asked Airbnb to explain what was discriminatory about my review - and they did not respond. Did I discriminate by writing an honest review about people who take advantage of others by using a system set up to help people with real needs?We are removing our listings from Airbnb and hope that other hosts will learn from our mistake and choose somewhere else to list their property. I would love advice on finding listing agents that actually protect the property owners. Just as a side note, I understand that the ADA has tried to provide protection to those with disabilities, and I totally support someone with a disability who genuinely needs a service animal. However, I don’t believe Sally or her husband have a disability."

However, a recent experience led me to contact customer service as I was treated badly by a host. The customer service reps are useless, merely reiterating policies that are neither helpful to guests nor in compliance with the law. There is no room for any change or flexibility in their policies, the purpose of the customer service reps is simply to placate you. In addition, they are currently not abiding by local guidelines. For example, I have a trip of 6 weeks booked in Scotland which means staying in the host's property. When I tried to cancel this to abide by local restrictions and laws, I was told I would be liable to pay for the first 30 days of the trip, plus service fees. It seems not only that this company are more in favour of hosts than guests, but also that they do nothing to alter their policy in line with local restrictions, thereby making their business functioning illegal.

Of course most countries continue to have closed borders.  Japan is one of them.  Currently tourists can simply not enter the country.  In having to cancel my plans every travel partner has been great EXCEPT AirBnB.  I have spent much time and effort only to lose with 4 reservations.  Best example is the cancellation of my apt in Tokyo.  The host is keeping 50% of the reservation and both she and AirBnB are saying that my reservation does not meet the ""extenuating circumstances"" policy.  Isn't it odd that although I am unable to enter the country that is not a good enough reason? Wow.  For many years AirBnB has been my go-to site for lodging arrangements.  I realize I’ve never really had issues because normally I make a reservation and keep it.  I have done some research and this is not an isolated instance.  Based on their service model, I have decided the only power I have is make others aware and stop giving them my business.  This kind of logic is simply unacceptable.  I hope anyone who is a traveler will take this into consideration when making decisions on lodging."

One week after I had to move out of a property (after 1 night) I still have daily messages “we are so sorry this has happened” from a different person every day. Even the host acknowledged the problem and Airbnb told me to amend my dates - which the host declined. Completely useless, I’m £1.8k out of pocket for a one night stay and I can’t get a resolution out of either host or airbnb. I‘ll never use again."

AVOID,"I used to use Airbnb a lot, but had a bad experience at a Amsterdam property where the place was uninhabitable. I incurred a lot of additional costs as a result of the last minute change and Airbnb, reluctant to give a refund, but eventually agreeing, would not compensate for the additional costs.After 2 years using hotels (I travel a lot), I decided the sanctuary of a Airbnb house would be 'coronavirus' safer, for a 4 night stay.Turned up and first night there were dogs barking all night and I got very little sleep. Second night, again there were dogs barking all night and again I got very little sleep. These were the owners dogs and  explained I could not stay another night.Airbnb relectantly refunded the 2 nights I did not stay, but as far as the first 2 nights, they did not care. I stayed there therefore I must pay even though the property did not properly describe itself as a dog breeders kennel, with the dogs housed in open cages next to the accommodation, that there are 5+ dogs and they bark, day and night.So, I will go back to hotels where you can rely on the experience and where you can complain face to face if there is an issue, rather than dealing with the moronic Airbnb support team."

I received a message ""full refund would be made"", followed by ""you selected a coupon, we cannot give you a cash refund now"". The coupon stated that I could use it until 31/12/2021. Didn't like it, but decided to keep it.

I needed a place to stay last minute for work and tried to book a place the day before, however they said ID verification was pending for 2-3 days, so I called to cancel the booking as I couldn't from the app with the verification stull under review. I was told by support not to worry that an ambassador would mark the date and time of my call, issue a refund and all would be okay, just look for a call in the next 24-48 hours. No call came, the booking got confirmed not canceled and then they messaged me (no call) almost a week later refusing any kind of refund. It has been over a month now and they have insulted me, called me a liar, refuse to listen to the recorded calls that prove my case, and had the audacity to offer a credit on the account for less then half the booking was.

We booked a large house and whilst the host has good morals and was very communicative and helpful fully refunded us for the house Airbnb keep the service fee. This is nearly £300. It’s disappointing enough not to be able to take your holiday due to restrictions beyond your control, but to find you don’t get a full refund is wrong.

While I appreciate it would be hard to monitor the crazy number of hosts, automated messages could improve the system at least. We stayed somewhere with a very misleading listing. We had to cancel our holiday (with an extremely unpleasant host). When I contacted AirBnB for support, all they said was to write a review, and because the host had a free cancellation policy, we could have left as soon as we arrived. Also, what's with the number of listings for two people that say no same sex groups? Surely this policy would be to avoid big same-sex groups, not to discriminate against gay couples?"

You then have to go to a guest that damaged yr home & ask them to pay & guess what two things happen 1. They dont pay but even worse, 2. they now know you have made a claim & will likely note such in yr review of them, so they write a horrific review of lies abt yr property. And when you go to AirBnB noting the lies which they verify 1st hand fr the back & forth dialogue on AirBNB - they do nothing- even after my 1st guest who was there just days before gave us a rave review. So now- not only did a guest damage yr home, but AirBnB has allowed them to destroy yr business w a horrid review based completely on lies. I wld also note that you can never reach anyone to discuss anything & their customer service response time is horrific. Everything takes weeks to resolve or get answers.

If you have a problem, as I did, it is extremely difficult to get customer service or any type of refund if applicable.My situation was that the host unit where I stayed had extremely unruly and noisy students on the other side of the wall.  Their cannabis smoke kept drifting into my unit, and the unit had numerous other issues around parking and lack of facilities.  I could not get any sleep so I had to change my length of stay from 3 months down to 1.  AirBnB then charged a substantial amount to my debit card, which I could not stop or get refunded through the bank.  It took me a while to figure out the complicated way of getting an AirBnB customer service rep, and when I finally did, I kept getting transferred to different people and had to keep explaining over.  One big problem is they always delete the email/message chain history, and so the information is never complete.  In the end, I got a little bit of money back from the host, but AirBnB did not acknowledge my situation nor refund me back the additional amount they charged.  And this outcome was after 2 months of messaging, and literally around 50 messages.Be careful using AirBnB!"

Airbnb asks what type of cancellation that the owner would prefer, I have chosen the strict non-refundable policy, which is supposed to mean that the client cannot cancel without paying some portion of the rent which increases as the arrival date is nearing.  I had to ¨eat¨ a large quantity of free cancellation during the Covid quarantine, but this has now ended and is no longer in effect, yet Airbnb still allows customers to cancel cost free, leaving myself without any income nor the change to Book to another client as the arrival date is next week.Airbnb has promised policy changes in order to be fair with the property owners, but this is not a reality.The clients making the reservations take advatages of Covid to cancel cost free, even though there are no restrictions in Europe and they can travel.So much for the political and organization changes that were so highly publisized. I Will cancel my Airbnb properties (5 of them) and go with Booking, they may be more expensive but the are coherent in the poliicies to both the owners and renters!"
1593,Penny,US,3 reviews,"Wednesday, October 7, 2020, 06:35:38 PM",1,Will NEVER use Airbnb again - read below to see why,"We had two trips planned to travel (my first time to Europe) - due to the pandemic all of our trip was cancelled. It started with an event we were going to see and then our flights were cancelled. I tried to converse with the hosts of the homes we were to stay in, and one tried to still convince me to come to her place even though I had no way to get there, and I still to this day, never have had a conversation with the other host because she never responded to my request for help (Airbnb can not force them to respond and does nothing to help if they don't). I cancelled both bookings -- in the midst of my cancelling Airbnb changed their policies about how refunds are handled due to the pandemic, but because I cancelled at a date before this policy allows refunds - my family is out $977.00. The hosts were then the only ones to ""approve"" of a refund - airbnb washed their hands of it. After countless efforts and months of reviewing anyway possible to get even an account credit, Airbnb said their was no refund to be given. I questioned their morals during a pandemic and whether they felt this was the best they could offer even with their policies. Still crickets. For years I have been an avid Airbnb user across the USA, and one of the most out-spoken about how amazing Airbnb is, but this experience with them is one that will stop me from ever using them again. Here is a review of what I said to them after all of this was over: As you are well aware that we cancelled two trips that were scheduled during June this year. I cancelled as soon as I knew we had no transportation (Delta Airline Flights) to get there and had no trip to go on -- due to the largest pandemic this world has seen in 100 years. I have done all that is possible to communicate this with Airbnb and the policies and response from hosts has been atrocious. I wouldn't treat my worst enemy on this earth the way Airbnb or the hosts have handled our cancelled trips - one host trying to convince me to still come to Germany and the second in Prague never taking a moment to respond back to my messages. Airbnb and Hosts can live well enough together without guests to pay their bills because that is how little you care about us. We were not offered refunds nor account credits to off-set our $977.00. As I understand how businesses work, policies are made for protection as I am a small business owner as well, but my reputation is more expensive than a refund of any kind -- I would think Airbnb would think this same way, but then again I wouldn’t treat a client the way I’ve been treated by Airbnb. I can not support a business that does not support its primary funding source nor offer any type of help because of a policy. Businesses much larger than Airbnb are doing all they can to keep customers happy and coming back offering rebates, refunds, etc. Yet Airbnb does nothing and the customer service agents are no greater because they are working in a toxic work environment that doesn't bode well to the lifestyle Airbnb wants the world to perceive. We as a customer of Airbnb have made an almost $1000 donation to the cause that I will NEVER support again and I also will take my own time to encourage others to not support Airbnb because the company’s policies and company’s / hosts lack of morals in a situation like this shows how Airbnb feels about the customers. I have never felt this strongly against a company but Airbnb has done their due diligence to cement it in my memory forever. That’s something that will ruin your company and change how you’re able to function as you’ll continue to lose business due to this action and reaction of how we were treated. I know we’re not the only ones who have been treated this way by Airbnb,I will reshare the conversation that we had with a customer service agent for reference as: I will leave you with this thought.....it truly is a sad day when business and corporations think nothing of keeping monies paid in good faith for a reservation including the hosts that Airbnb represents feel comfortable keeping this money and feel no remorse or responsibility to return a portion or all for a reservation that was not able to be fulfilled given any circumstance.I too am a small business owner and would not ever consider doing this as it would kill my reputation and also my morals would not let me do thisSo to my point I will always remember that I have a 977.00 donation to Airbnb and the hosts involved, and I hope you all use it wisely. In this memory of how I was treated I will not return to Airbnb again as it is too expensive for my pocket book and I will be sure I make mention of this to whomever I see in my travels.I’m so sorry for this to end like this for your part in all of this you do not deserve to work in an environment as toxic as this, I do wish you the very best. Thank you for your time."

In the mist of Covid 19 and the challenges of traveling at this time, we were disappointed that neither Fallon or Airbnb would refund (nor give us a credit) of our $670 deposit.  Let me summarize the situation:My friend and I booked our trip to Savannah/Charleston back in October 2019.  Our original dates of travel were March/April 2020.  With the onset of the pandemic and our optimistic belief that we would be able to travel again, in early March, we contacted our Airbnb hosts and changed our reservations to September.  They both agreed and extended the reservations until September.In June, we cancelled our Airbnb reservation for both Savannah and Charleston.  We did this for several reasonsInstances of COVID-19 and resulting deaths increasing in our countryRestrictions put on place by our Governor for travel to New York from South CarolinaNothing in the data indicating that the pandemic would be over (or a vaccine/cure would be ready) by September.My personal health issues of diabetes and hypertension. Advice from the CDC and my own physician indicated that individuals with these conditions are more vulnerable for serious health implications from COVID and should NOT travel.In good faith, we wanted to give our hosts plenty of notice and opportunity to rebook if possible.  Our Savannah host did refund our money except for $81.45 in fees which we appreciated. However, our host, Fallon, in Charleston, refuses to refund us our $670.  When we reached out to the Airbnb Resolution Department, the Resolution Representative was not able to resolve this issue for us.  He was professional and kind but simply quoted standard cancellation. At his request, we provided him my personal health information and a letter from my doctor. Bottom line, no refund. We have written to Airbnb CEO, Brian Chesky as well and are awaiting a reply (so far two certified letters have gotten lost). We find this unacceptable and unethical. Our Charleston host has $670 of our money for services we are not receiving due to the pandemic. Airbnb’s own extenuating circumstances policy was recently extended to end of September.  In good faith, we gave plenty of notice of cancellation.  We feel strongly that an exception should be allowed for this pandemic.Airbnb has stepped up to provide assistance to their hosts in this financially difficult time. We are shocked that they are not supporting their customers in the same fashion.  Be aware if you are booking through Airbnb."

I was regrettably obliged to cancel my holiday reservation due to Covid 19 and clear and unambiguous information published by AirBnB stated that if cancellations were the result of government mandated directions following Covid 19, all booking costs would be refunded. I explained in writing the reasons for my cancellation, the UK Foreign Office having continued to advise against all non essential travel to Spain, and yet AirBnB have refused to assist in securing a full refund. Attempting to navigate the AirBnB customer assistance on the Web Page is a task in itself, and when you finally reach someone, they simply avoid rationale dialogue and simply recite a script.

Recently, the last person that was in there damaged 2 items, took nearly all of the bath towels with them and had an unapproved dog in the unit (30 day rental). When I filed a claim, the renter of course denied the issues and Airbnb’s insurance person also denied it. Meanwhile, I am a super host with a 5 star rating and have never asked for  reimbursement before from Airbnb in the years I’ve used them (in spite of dealing with these same issues before) I highly recommend VRBO/Homeaway - they are more professional in all aspects. I’ve used Airbnb on both the host and guest side and ve been thoroughly unimpressed with the company and most of all their customer service (now they do not answer their customer service # anymore, so if you have an immediate issue, it takes days before Airbnb calls you back - rediculous!)"

I'm aware bars and restaurants in the city are closed but will reopen within 10 days, there's plenty more things he can do instead. So he complains about the first thing he can find which is 'not listed in your rules' and can then moan to airbnb abnd get his money back. He sent me a whatsapp message late at night after he'd gone out asking for the wifi codes. I responded by sending him the codes and asking him to follow the same protocol I've asked every other guest when returning late at night after I've gone to bed which is to use a torch, small lights and avoid switching on overhead lights. He responded by losing his temper, sending histrionic whatsapp messages refused any attempt at resolving the situation and announced he was leaving in the morning after one night. He complained to airbnb about 'rules which are not listed in the description', which airbnb accepted. I sent airbnb screenshots of his messages, any intelligent person reading those, the review he left would likely concur with my assessment that this was an individual displaying traits associated with a narcissistic personality disorder. airbnb has a business model that stinks. Without the hosts they would have no business well this host is most likely going to advertise the room on gumtree and take someone in on a longer term basis. It's a shame because I don't especially want someone in the flat with me all the time but unfortunately I need the money. airbnb is not a 'community' It epitomises the degeneracy of this BABYLON 'civilisation' which is rapidly going down the pan. A few people getting obscenely rich at the expense of others. Customer service? What customer service?"

It says on gift card that ‘funds never expire’. So they’d held on to gift card and now go to use it. On Airbnb’s website it says funds never expire if you upload money to Airbnb. Slightly different story. And now Airbnb customer service is refusing to talk to my in-laws. Gift card should explain you need to upload to Airbnb so they stand behind what they write. This was a lot of money that Airbnb is not honoring and essentially stealing from us

When I got to it and found another family in I called both host and airbnb. First one didn't answer the call. Second one promised to fix it and call back in 15 minutes but they didn't. I had to look for a hotel at 23:00 p.m. Nearest one was 2 hours driving dar away. I paid £150 for the hotel. I asked for a refund and compensation but was offered £60 voucher.

I looked up the website for the city she was talking about, Sevierville TN. They are welcoming visitors. So obviously it was not due to covid. I'm guessing probably a friend or family member wanted to stay that week & she used covid as an excuse.

I was disillusioned to think that Airbnb was a professional entity. I had the worst experience with customer service. I mean have I never spoken to people less invested in their jobs than these folks. One in particular put me on hold for 1:55 minutes because her child was crying in the background and she didn’tWant to deal with my issue. Another told me that their policies were not updated and I said that’s fine but doesn’tThat just imply that the the policies that you DO have in place are the ones that should be adhered to? I had an issue of how the host had misrepresented the recording devices within his posting. They told me that they DO see that it is against their policy but because he did mention something (left out the fact that there were three other cameras and posted it under the wrong category of the listing) there was nothing that they could do. Mind you I tried to resolve my problem days prior via their chat bot and app customer service reps and no one called me back so To a day before my check in day I decided to call and take matters in my own hands. Some of the stories above is what I endured and many more. I didn’t sleep all night waiting for a call back. I spent an entire night with a bunch of inept human beings who did not want to help me. I was offered a call back On the same day of my actual check in date an hour before my check in was due. I had explained that it takes three hours for me to get to the Destiination and that I would have preferred to know the resolution of my claim in order to plan better. Supervisors do not even know what they’re doing because how could you offer a customer a call to resolve the matter if the matter is going to activate within an hour and the person has already traveled far? It’s obvious that they don’t want you to speak to their customer service reps because it takes about an hour just to speak to someone who is not a robot but this is the first and last time I will use Airbnb. I ended up canceling the trip and losing money but I rather lose money than deal with a company that’s supposed to be a multi million dollar company is actually a coercive and shady ☝️ . I’m disgusted.

Because of the impact caused by COVID-19, all Airbnb owners are having extremely hard time. Many of them are going out of business and remaining are struggling for survival. I am one of Airbnb owner in Japan who is trying everything to keep the house going. In order to do that, I have dropped the room rate to less than half of last year. Luckily I have guests occasionally. However one of the guest rated our room negatively, he pointed out the room rate is too high. Unfortunately there are guests making booking without knowing the standard rate. Because of this one negative review, I lost the Super Owner status on Airbnb. I am very disappointed and find Airbnb rule lacks fairness and considerations. I wanted to share my experience with many who use Airbnb and, hoping corrective actions to be taken. We need extra effort to walk through COVID-19 in every aspects of our life. Hope Airbnb to do the same as a company."

1617,Mike,US,2 reviews,"Saturday, October 3, 2020, 02:36:54 AM",1,My recent experience with Airbnb was terrible.,"My recent experience with Airbnb was about as bad as I can imagine.I reserved a beach front condo for three nights in Imperial Beach.  It was important to my daughters and me to have a beach front condo – it would be the one year anniversary of the death of my wife and their mother, and Imperial Beach was our favorite vacation location.  Because this was so important I paid in full more than three months in advance - $970.  15 days before the trip the “hosts” informed me that the beach front condo was not available but that a property a half mile away was.  I was very disappointed, but knowing it would be next to impossible to find anything near the beach at that late date I accepted the alternative.  I contacted Airbnb Support to express my concerns about what happened.  The customer support rep “enlightened” me (her word) that the host should have cancelled and refunded through their platform instead of offering an alternative property (to my knowledge NOT an Airbnb property but a VRBO property.) I made it very clear that since it was so close to the trip that I did not want to cancel the reservation.  Five days before the trip Airbnb emailed me to inform me that the reservation was cancelled and that I would receive a full refund.  They “graciously” gave me a $97 credit  for any other property if I made the reservation within 30 days.  I could find no beachfront properties in Imperial Beach on their website.  I was forced to make a reservation at a hotel that cost more than twice what I paid for the original condo. This ended up costing me $2184 for last minute beachfront lodging for the same three days, $1214 more than what I paid for through Airbnb because their host did not follow their company procedures. On October 1, two weeks after the trip, Airbnb customer support contacted me to “assist me” with this issue.  This rep had clearly not reviewed my situation and the chat log from the previous customer service rep.  Ultimately this rep offered an apology, but nothing more.I will never use Airbnb again, and I will share my experience with anyone who asks about it."

I've called them every single day and am told every single day that someone will be in touch between 3 and 48 hours to help resolve the bug. No one has ever called me back. Not once.

I booked an apartment- it read “Cancel by 1st October for Full Refund” - unfortunately I had to cancel, due to the current crisis - I messaged the host & tried to cancel within 24 hours of booking. Host said fine, Airbnb have the money... I tried to cancel on Airbnb & I would lose all monies. AT NO POINT COULD I HAVE EVER RECEIVED ANY MONIES BACK. So stating to cancel by 1st October for a full refund was a complete deception. The *read minus the service charge & 30 days. The apartment was only ever available for the 29 days booked. So at no point was anyone ever entitled to any refund... but it advertised as “Cancel by 1st October for Full Refund” Ronald from Airbnb cannot understand that this is false advertising. I have asked if I should cancel - giving the host a chance to re-list but Airbnb are telling me to keep the booking??? My money is currently with Airbnb... they don’t pay the host until day after check in. Airbnb are refusing to do anything..They don’t read the messages, I spoke on the phone going round in circles, then received follow up message stating I had agreed on the call, I replied straight away to say no that hadn’t happened. Still don’t know whether to hit cancel or not. Been going on for 10 days now! I will be reporting them. Will not use Airbnb again."

No worries it is your right to rent to who you wish, however this is not how I have ever been treated in the past by any individuals or even employers (we now own our own contracting form).

I've tried to resolve my issue through multiple channels (Webchat, Email, Phone and Social Media) and pretty much as soon as I tell them that I have a problem with the room (not as described, rude hosts, terrible experience etc.) they will proceed with ""Thanks for contacting us, we will forward this to a specialist for further review and contact you soon"". They will never respond to you after this. If you get the ""forward to specialist"" card, you can assume with certainty that you won't be helped and that you will never see your money again.This behaviour is criminal as it is designed to take your money and run with it. There is absolutely nothing you can do except for chargeback. Unfortunately some hosts have become aware of this and started to abuse the system to their benefit (with some even trying to force you out so they can rent to someone else). It is disheartening to see that the once great couchsurfing concept has been dragged down by corporate greed and opportune fraudsters.This is the last time I've booked with AirBnB, and I strongly recommend to stay far, far away from it.

The accommodation I had was fine not the hosts fault but the neighbours were a nightmare one of them just kept knocking on the door the first time asking what I was doing there then proceeded to start screaming and swearing at me, calling me all sorts of names after 2 or 3 days of this and her calling the police! I basically couldn’t stay there any longer the host was brilliant, felt bad (Obviously) and gave me a full refund on his part but when I called the useless people at Airbnb they wouldn’t refund their service fee! Despite at least 10 calls and asking to speak to a manager and them saying a manager will call you back no one has bothered! The only thing I have is a message saying they aren’t refunding as the host went against their policy and refunded me first! I mean ffs!??! My holiday was totally ruined and yet the tossers at Airbnb won’t refund a measly £84, pathetic AVOID AVOID AVOID!"

Which we had booked in January of 2020. The host nor Airbnb will refund our money due to their strict policy of ""no cancellations"" UNLESS THERE ARE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. COVID FALLS UNDER THAT CLAUSE.  We have been fighting with them since March to get a refund. Our business was shut down due to Covid on the 13th of March 2020. We are now hiring an attorney to recoup our money. DO NOT USE AIRBNB OR EASTSIDE VILLAS. They have no compassion for the current climate or what people are having to endure.

I honor guest request to cancel and return the money through PayPal which I have proof of transaction so the guest can get his money back. However Airbnb took an equal amount of money i already send them to resolve the refund issue out of my future reservation. Do not send this company any money outside of their platform as they have no morals and just help themselves through my payout. It is really criminal and if there's any arty out there who wants to go help me get my money back knock yourself. You can be them all you want.

Some of the people I was going with smoke and the host stated it would be a 300 dollar extra charge if she found any evidence of smoking. I did not feel comfortable with that so I decided to cancel. Then i got a email stating they did a background check for me and no longer could i be a member. This is after I paid money and have not received it back yet. Now this unwarranted background check showed a misdemeanor charge from when i was 19. This was 15 years ago.  i was Young and stupid .

I've been hosting for some years now, I've encountered issues, but nothing major, and they were all more or less fixed.  But recently there was a big change, they fired most of customer service agents and now they only operate via chat, and they send you an automatic message saying that they are responding later than usual, about 48 to 72 hours.  Communicating via chat is not an issue, also the delay is totally understandable because of the circumstances.  What is not acceptable is the fact that Airbnb is allowing guest to violate rules and do nothing about it.  Us hosts are being left to hang dry.  When a guest violates the contract, specially about a matter of safety, it is Airbnb responsibility to penalize or even remove the user.  But unfortunately they just seat there and do nothing.  My family and I live on site, so we take our safety very seriously, therefore we are removing our listing and closing my Airbnb account.  People that are considering to host beware, look around and you'll find many accounts on how things have gone south for many hosts."

About 2 weeks before our trip I checked with Vermont health dept and was told that I would have to quarantine for 14 days upon my arrival, so I canceled my AirBnB reservation. I got a  refund minus a  $52 ""service fee"". Ok, whatever. Within minutes of cancellation I was contacted by my AirBnB host who informed me that many guest were staying with her and no one has had to quarantine.... so she convinced me to go ahead and rebook. A few days later I learned from a family member who lives in Vermont that I would indeed have to quarantine for 14 days if I came to Vermont. So I decided to cancel my new booking. This time, since I was less than 2 weeks from my trip, I only got 1/2 my refund .. so I'm out over $200! Attempts to contact my host or AirBnB were a waste of time... the host said to contact AirBnB and wanted nothing to do with giving me a full refund. AirBnB took hours on hold and would take my info and promised to get back to me which they never did. I filed an appeal which AirBnB denied because I had no 'extenuating circumstances"". I guess AirBnB Hosts lying to clients and ripping them off for over $200 is not considered an extenuating circumstance. I finally was able to successfully dispute the charge with my CC company. Now AiRBnB responds to me wanting to know why and threatening to cancel any future stays I make and to cancel my account.

Then the owner only gave me 1/4 of the whole cost back to me. I contacted airbnb but there is no way of talking to a customer service.  The only thing you can do is to email them and hope that they will answer back to you.  It's been three days and I still have not heard back from them.

My one star is not on the behalf of the host but on the overall experience with Airbnb canceling my reservation after check-in. My guess and I drove from Atlanta to Daytona. The next day we drove to Tampa to check into Joe's place. After arriving to the home, 2 hours later an angry customer service agent from Airbnb called me demanding my guests and I to leave. The agent made it seem like the host was not supposed to rent out the home. so when I asked for compensation and help to find another place, The agent told me my account was under investigation as well  for what reason she couldn't tell me and said an ambassador will give me a call in which that call has never happen and I'm writing this review 24 hours later. I've been a Airbnb guest since 2011 with almost 40 reviews, 98% rate and I will never recommend  Airbnb to anyone or use airbnb again. I just hope you don't book a place and be asked to leave with no reason or excuse and have to wait 15 days for the money to return to your card. They said the money will be returned to my card but I went through a whole process, I had to have some type of document to prove that I left the property and all this was communicated through email. So at this point I don't even know if I'm going to get a refund. I don't know what Airbnb has going on but if it happened to me it can happen to you. There's no reason why my account should be under investigation. it was clearly something they made up so they didn't have to compensate me. It has been 2 weeks and I still have not been compensated. I was told I was going to receive up to $250 for a hotel stay. The proof is in the email and after asking for the funds they have not responded or reimburse me and this is a edit version added to my review."
1684,Cynthia Stocker,US,3 reviews,"Tuesday, September 15, 2020, 06:29:11 PM",1,Think twice,"In late August I booked an Airbnb because I had to travel 6 hours round trip for cancer treatment.  With covid being so scary I thought it would make sense to stay at an Airbnb because they were advertising their new cleaning standards.  I contacted the host who assured me their home would be available for the time periods I requested.  She offered a 5% weekly discount.  I noticed this host charged the higher end of the fees; $95.00 cleaning fee and highest service fee allowed.  But with it being covid and the fact that she got things together for me so quickly, I thought it would be worth it.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  Upon arrival I noticed musty odor everywhere.  The yard had not been kept and weeds were growing everywhere.  Not the biggest deal, but as I went into the kitchen my feet literally stuck to the floor!  The kitchen table was covered in old food, the chairs were wobbly and one actually broke when I sat in it.  I had to wash pots and pans before I could cook because food was stuck to them and they were greasy.  The oven was dirty and food was about an inch deep behind the trash can and oven.  I had to clean before I could move my things in.  When I contacted the host to tell her the problem, she made excuses and blamed it on her husband.  To make matters worse there weren't even any cleaning supplies.  I had to use vinegar.  I went to try to sleep in the master bed and found it broken too.  Several blankets smelled like mildew and had to be washed but, when I took them to the laundry it smelled of cat urine!  I spoke to the host about this and explained I didn't think a $95.00 cleaning fee was appropriate; again more excuses.  They even tried to tell me it could smell like cat urine because no animals had ever been there.  Which is funny because she offers a pet fee AND there is a pet door between the kitchen and garage! She did refund $30.00 at first.  Now get this, her husband called me at 8:30 on a Sunday night and started trying to manipulate me!  He told me how his wife is a people pleaser and my review made her so sad and upset.  He said he was an out work entertainer and this was their income and it was really hard them.  Did I mention I am going through cancer treatment?  So I guess I am supposed to clean their house, after driving to treatment, eat the fees, after paying my medical bills, and feel sorry for them?  Not to mention feel guilty when I am supposed to be resting 12 hours before driving back to treatment? He then refunded the remaining $65.00 fee.  But wait it gets worse.  So after listening to his sad tell of woe.  He and his wife actually send me nasty grams through airbnb telling me what a lair I am and threatening me.  Airbnb is unreachable so there is no way to report them!  It is just crazy.  I have documentation, photos etc.  Look, I have stayed at airbnb's for years.  Not just in the US but other countries and NEVER have gone through something like this.  If I could give no stars I would.  I have a great reputation and have always told the truth about my stay. So why would I make something up.  Also photos don't lie.  Think twice before staying with Airbnb."

It exposed a filthy and very old mattress. I was so disgusted I stopped my investigation. I have some pictures of the condition of the home. It has a possible roach and bed bug infestation. I felt so uncomfortable I left a day earlier than scheduled. Also I Pty a request to change the dates of the reservation with the host. I contacted her and asked for an approval and got no response. This was an overall horrible experience and if it is typical of Airbnb I will not be using the service again, I also will actively discourage others from doing so as well."

The rental was cancel by Airbnb with absolutely no communication to me because they thought I was someone I am not with a criminal record.  Accidents happen right ..... That would be the case if Airbnb did not blow it off like they did and not help me get back into that rental.  If you want to be sure you have a place to stay on your vacation do not use Airbnb."

Airbnb will either refund all service fees or issue travel credit that includes them for covered cancellations. In order to cancel under the policy, you will be required to attest to the facts of and/or provide supporting documentation for your extenuating circumstance.What reservations are covered* Reservations made on or before 14 March 2020: YES, MY RESERVATION WAS MADE BEFORE. * check-in date between 14 March 2020 and 15 August 2020,: YES, CHECK-IN DATE WAS 18 July 2020.PROOF OF FLIGHTS CANCELLED: yes, provided by us already (cancelled by EasyJet and also by Brussels Airlines, emails forwarded to AirBnB as proof).I paid a total of  £947.36 and I received a refund of only £528.26, not the full refund as stated by Covid extenuating circumstances.As mentioned on your website, for extenuating circumstances caused by covid, customer should be able to receive a full refund, as we were not able to fly, airlines cancelled our flights.We have provided evidence of Flights cancellations (by Easyjet and Brussels Airlines).So we are asking for the rest of the refund to be paid or we can accept vouchers to use the service again.Please honour your terms and conditions.

We rented a gorgeous 4br 4 bath home minutes from the beach. Sounds enticing right? We arrived Saturday afternoon around 2:30pm. Our check in time was 4pm so we decided to do a few things to kill time. The email told us we would be able to check in early but at 3:30 we spoke with them and they refused to let us in until exactly 4pm and they were extremely rude about the situation. The next day we see the tropical storm is moving our way and growing in strength, and we have two small children so we decided it would be best to cancel and leave this morning. We called and inquired about receiving a refund for the three days we didn’t stay since they called for 12-18 inches of rain, winds up to 100mph, and surges up to 11ft which is absolutely unsafe for anyone. We called Turn Key Rentals (the company airbnb claimed was responsible for refunds) and they were very rude as well. The woman on the phone told us “you aren’t leaving because the weather, you’re leaving because you feel unsafe” ummm no s*** lady we don’t really have a death wish.... We only asked for the $495 from the three nights we weren’t able to stay. We left at 4am this morning and now the storm is a category 2 hurricane making a direct hit to the area we were staying with 20-24 inches of rain and 11-16 feet surges and winds of 100+ mph. Staying ensures you will be at least without food and electricity for several days and no way to leave (if the house withstands the storm) in which case they would obviously charge you for however many days you stayed over your checkout date. Several others were done the same way by the same people. Now they aren’t accepting any calls and won’t email back. ABSOLUTE F###### SCAM!!!!!!"

If you have a problem with your stay it is virtually impossible to find contact details to log a complaint.

I started a chat with Airbnb to complain and they are not getting back to me and absolutely no alternative contact details to try to speak to someone or try another route. The accommodation we stayed in was not fit for anyone and was unsafe, I would never risk booking with Airbnb again especially as they have zero customer service to try to help if you are in unsafe sub-standard accommodation."

I had an issue with my account so I reached out to customer ""support"", and quickly discovered that not only was I NOT going to be helped; rather, the employee assigned to my case would essentially respond like a robot (the same thing was stated multiple times, verbatim) or go radio silent until I was forced to follow up, again and again, only to close my case without resolution. Airbnb then sent a customer service survey, post interaction, to which I responded with an honest and unflattering ""review"" (with no follow-up). Finally, I called and was met with a case support agent who essentially yelled into my ear before stating, ""Okay, I have to go now, bye,"" and hanging up before I could even respond.I used to use Airbnb religiously; however, after this experience, I hesitate to book through the service again."

Use VRBO instead! Do NOT host for Airbnb but host on VRBO! We put our house on Airbnb nearly two years ago. They used to have good customer service. This year has been horrible! As a host I called in about an issue with a guest that tried to extort money from me and then left me a false review when I didn't comply. I called Airbnb customer support to get help. I was told multiple times by Airbnb not to respond to the review until someone contacted me from Airbnb. Two months later someone finally responds to me yes I said 2 months later. I had tried calling multiple times and I had other issues to discuss including one being a refund for a guests who no longer could stay due to Covid-19. This guests has yet to see his refund. I complied with Airbnb and did not respond to this false review and now I am being told that they will not remove the review or allow me to respond! This is just unacceptable! We had another issue where guests completely damaged my house and Airbnb's new policy is you have to file the claim with estimates, etc before your next guests arrives or you will not get a refund. (We were not aware of this change with Airbnb) We had guests leaving and guests arriving the same day. My housekeeper contacted me right away. I drove to our hoise to assess the damage which is a 45 minute drive away. Our next guests were arriving at 2:30. It was already 1 and I had to have everything submitted to Airbnb before my next guests arrived even though I had pictures for documentation. Airbnb never refunded us for the damages even though I had receipts and proper documentation for the damages. This was back around February before the Covid-19 lockdown. Airbnb no longer has anyone who can speak to you on the phone. They open customer support messages through the app. Good luck on getting an actual customer service rep to reply! Oh I had an Airbnb ""Bot"" ask me multiple times if I still needed assistance. Once you finally have a customer support rep contact you they have absolutely no desire to help you in any way. This is coming from me the Host and my guest who never received their refund for a stay they never had.I had to call VRBO about a guest and they answered right away and helped me. I didn't have any issues or have to wait for someone to get back to me which was good because my guest wanted to extend their stay by two days. Everything was done within 15 minutes! As my calendar tapers down I will be removing my listing from Airbnb and encouraging friends of mine to do the same! Guests or Hosts are NOT getting the support they need! Stay with VRBO!"

I’m beyond words at the absolute disrespect, complete lack of any kind of customer service or even acknowledgment of my issue which is basically that Airbnb stole €1800 from my bank account 4 weeks ago and are not responding to pay it back!!! This is a joke of a company and I warn anyone reading this to NEVER BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY! There is no service and you could end up in a dangerous or critical situation with no support from these guys! My own situation is awful, stressful, time consuming and so frustrating but I am home and safe and thankfully was able to rely on friends and family for help!I booked accommodation 2 days before a trip to Malta, the host in question declined as it was only 2 of us in a large property. All okay with me, my friend found another property through HolidayLettings.co.uk and we were happy with that and treated so well with AMAZING customer service throughout. BUT!! Airbnb charged me the full + €1800 for the full cost of the 10 days stay! I contacted the host immediately and she tried to cancel at her side but couldn’t, I couldn’t cancel at my side as I would be charged for cancelling so we both contacted Airbnb - easy right?! A bloody joke! I opened a ticket with them and she also called and mailed support. I rang or emailed support every day of my holiday with no reply. I called again and quoted my ticket # and asked to speak to management, the lady said she would update my ticket that was with another team..the team that was not answering me for two weeks solid! I resorted to posting on twitter about my anger at situation and threatened legal and media approach to get my money back. ONLY then did another (different team!) reply and say they have (again!) added to my open ticket and sorry for inconvenience! But To wait because they have a queue and my item is critical apparently!?!! I’m at week 4 now, they only reply when I threaten legal or media again, same message, no actual actions. It seems they employee enough people to answer angry messages on media but seem no one is actually trying to fix ILLEGAL activity like stealing from a persons account! So here I am, €1800 down for a service I never received, that hosts house ended up showing me booked in there for ten days so she couldn’t rent to anyone else...it’s a circus and no one is doing anything!!I’m resorting to my bank taking a dispute against them to try get money back but it can take weeks more. I did nothing wrong, I followed process to open ticket immediately I called and messaged as did the host and still I’m in this situation. Thankfully I have help, but if I didn’t I could have been stranded in Malta or without food or rent money right now because they cannot fix a simple issue. I spent my whole holiday trying to fix this, it ruined my only time away this year, I was on to them everyday and worrying about money and having to borrow throughputs it was extremely stressful every day wasting time and energy trying to get my money back.I will be suing for return of money, stress, wasted time, emotional distress, and legal fees...I WARN EVERYONE! - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY WILL ROB YOU OR LEAVE YOU STRANDED!"

Only an example, you can not even see a photo of the person you’re about letting into your house anymore! What the hell?!!! So that Airbnb don’t think I might discriminate between people based on their photos as I choose who can stay in my house?!!!! I can discriminate if I want. We’re talking about people staying in my house not yours!!! That is none of your business who I choose to let into my house and what is my criteria Airbnb. Let’s be honest, it’s not even about what you’re claiming for, it’s about how you can get more business when people just accept request having no idea who the guest or the host is... You’re making so much money off me and if my house was not there you would have nothing to make a business off. Then also you can do nothing to protect my family and I. If something happens you don’t even give a darn. Then just sh...t up... there are too much sh...t like this, I just mentioned one... I hate Airbnb so much!!!"

Hopefully once they go public they crash when investors see how incompetent the operation is and go bankrupt, it would be wonderful to see! If you want to work there, just go out and start robbing people instead because it’s the same thing. They withhold money from hosts, don’t pay insurance claims and take weeks to call you back if you’re lucky. Do yourself a favor, use any other company you want, just avoid these scumbags and you’ll be happy you did !"

I have had some good experiences but it has very little with the company itself or with how it is managed. With every host you take a risk since when the experience is negative, Airbnb will not come to the rescue. They will tell you on the phone to get out of the house and take pictures, but they will do nothing in regard to a filthy or dishonest host and may not refund you. Airbnb is very quick to get your money but is slow to give your money back, and their service fee is high! Their help center is full of cliches and polite responses that do not go through with any actions."

They are liars and cheaters. Lastly, I rented a house for total of 850$ for 2 nights. It was a dirty, filthy & disgusting place to stay. I have never had such an awful experience in my vacations, that ruins it. Cleaning wasn't our main issue, we cleaned every single spot, the main issue was the safety. The place had a neighbor which had an overfriendly dog who had come to us and block our door. Also, he spread his poops all over the place. When we went & told the owner he cussed at us & ran into the house to bring a weapon so we just came inside grabbed everything & left the place because we couldn't imagine what he would come back with, a weapon, or who knows what. Furthermore, there was a mouse in which we had heard noises every night. Also,  every morning we saw pieces of wood that had been thrown from the cabinets and it looked as if the mouse had eaten the wood, and another day we found our bags damaged by the mouse. There were no cell service and the wifi connection was very weak, so we couldn't contact the owner or customer service to solve our issue. While we came back we immediately contacted customer service and explain the whole story but after 2 weeks of investigation, they just refund us the cleaning fee and they said this is the only thing we can do since you should first solve the issue with the host then call us during the reservation, not after that. I explained them that there was no connection and we called you immediately after we came back. They said you are newcomers, the neighbor's behavior is not the host's business. I would say, this was the worst experience we have ever had. I just can say even for your safety don't rent a place from this website since they don't care about it at all. Moreover, they add all positive reviews in their website and erase the ones they don't like. They erased ours, they are liars and do false advertisement. Nothing was the same as the pictures when we arrived there. Consequently, you can not even find out how the place is from the reviews since they just add the good ones."

When I contacted the host about cancelling and receiving a refund she was unwilling to give any amount of refund, she stated that Airbnb refunds. She did not have a COVID 19 policy for cancellations and when I contacted Airbnb about getting a refund through their COVID policy, they were not willing to help me at all. The host (Alexis) told me she would get half my money because that was ""fair."" My question was fair to who? I am not going and get a fraction of my money back (Airbnb did not offer to refund me half maybe a 1/3 of what I paid) and you are getting a full night even though there is no cleaning, no service, no EFFORT. They didn't even refund me the service fee! Every attempt I made was met with Sorry no can do and then the conversation was ended and case closed by them. To cancel the reservation I had to accept the ""refund"" there was no option to say no. So now she can book it again on those days and get double the money. Again who is this fair to?

From reading these reviews, I am thinking we will never hear back from them. But, hopefully, my bank has always been good and will reverse the charges.

She moved us to a different room that was much better, but then the next day, she and her daughter accused us of messing with the way their appliances were plugged and costing them $95 for an electrical inspection; when we didn't and had absolutely no reason to. The host-daughter did not objectively serve us and was hardly involved as opposed to her mom. We filed a complaint with airbnb the next day and the hosts kicked us out, though we had not verbally-officially told them we were canceling our reservation. They falsely accused us of filing a complaint of theft against them and took pictures of our naturally messy room before we had time to clean it up, and accused us to airbnb corp. for vandalizing/trashing their place. In summary, these hosts do not practice the attitude of ""customer is always right""."

After reviewing other Airbnb customer comments I can see for sure it's not just my opinion.  Talk with a ""live"" person is impossible.  Phone tells you to go to the web site and then hang up.  The Airbnb Web site provides no answers and is not a resource to the customer.  It just states Airbnb policy and there is no way to ask follow up questions.  Like many of the reviews, I have been waiting for a refund (in the amount of $3,331.04) for over 4 months.  For 3 of the months I did not hear anything from Airbnb on status.  5 weeks ago a message appeared stating my refund would be sent on 8/23 and arrive at my bank by 8/28.  On 9/2 another message appeared that my refund would be sent on 8/28 and arrive at my bank by 9/8.  Its 9/8 and guess what . . .NOTHING.  No update and the message stating when I would receive my refund if gone from their site.  Tried to call customer service again today and was frustrated by the message stating only questions on recent trip cancellations and existing reservations would be answered.  The message then said I would be receiving a text to submit my question.  Received the text but when I hit the link it would not access any site.  ANOTHER DEAD END TO THIS ONGOING, FRUSTRATING AND TOTALLY NON CUSTOMER FRIENDLY CUSTOMER SERVICE SITE.  Have never used this phrase but . . .I HATE AIRBNB!!! Have emailed three separate messages over the past 3 weeks asking for an update on my refund.  No response from their ""customer-less"" service.  Seems Airbnb should be paying all their customers interest in holding our money.  Airbnb should be ashamed on how it is treating its customers.  Based on customer feedback and evaluation of their customer service efforts, COVID is the least of their problems.  Would be more concerned with customers boycotting Airbnb for unacceptable and uncaring service.  The convenience of providing Airbnb listings is significantly overshadowed and diminished by the time consumption & frustration it causes its customers.  For anyone reading this . . DO NOT USE AIRBNB IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN IN HAVING TO CHANGE OR CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION.  YOU MIGHT NEVER GET YOUR MONEY BACK AND MAY NEVER GET A REASON WHY EITHER."

A few days before my trip they canceled it and sent me $50 back. There was no reason for them to cancel so I thought it must have been some sort of glitch. The host already re-booked the place and was unresponsive when I asked about the rest of the money, so I contacted customer service and was told a specialist would call me back ""very soon"". It was Saturday and my reservation was on Tuesday. A day went by,I contacted them again and they told me I'd hear back in 5 minutes. 12 hours later, Sunday night, I call back and tell them I need to know what's going on so I can either adjust or cancel my trip; I can't afford to just book somewhere else if I'm not eventually going to get my remaining $300 back. Monday I still haven't heard from them so I decide to just book a hotel instead, which wasn't cheap, and I told their ""frontline"" customer service that I would be disputing it with my bank if I didn't hear back before the end of the day. It's now been nearly 3 weeks, I disputed the transaction like I said I would, continue to message and call them, and still no ""specialist"" has called me back. They keep telling me it will be ""soon"" and within a ""timely manner"". My bank is still in the process of investigating and I can no longer contact Airbnb at all because my reservation isn't within 72 hours (it's actually -336 hours away now!). They stopped responding to all messages, the host has yet to respond as well.Don't ever book with Airbnb. I know covid makes things more difficult for businesses, but 3 weeks is ridiculous, especially for a customer you left with no place to stay and are withholding hundreds of dollars from. The 3 founders and owners of this company are worth $3 billion each. The company makes enough to have somewhat decent customer service. Instead, their customer service is nonexistent. They are exploiting the pandemic to scam their customers. Thousands of others have had similar complaints. NEVER book with Airbnb, go with another company instead."

You choosing your refund policy as moderate to none doesn't mean anything because they will give it to them.  I notice some people are professional scammers and go around trying to make up issues to stay at people's places for free. This has happened to me a few times already. I think a lot of bums do this, as well. The Airbnb customer service people arent well trained and don't fairly look at both sides and lack common sense. I had one issue with a guy who decided he didn't want to be there after a week of staying there and they gave him a refund. It doesn't matter that he was staying there for only $20 a day and showering several times a day and taking really long baths,  asking me for rides to places, using my utilities.. I ended up giving more than I got and he got a refund! Mind you... my refund policy is only if they cancel a week in advance and he stayed there for free because airbnb people don't care.Another more recent one... she was rude, and was really loud the whole several hours she was there but her name was monique.  She pushed me to let her in before check in time, she already had a terrible review and despite my better judgement and to my quick regret I let her stay; she made this really obnoxious, LOUD hiccup noise the entire time she was there without any break... I finally asked what that noise was and she said she was laughing. I highly doubt anything is that funny.  She made that noise without stopping for more than a minute at a time.  I asked her several times to turn down her music and stop laughing so loudly. She didn't.  She used my shower as soon as she got there without asking bbn if anyone else needed tob use it. She was rude, and stole my shampoo,  conditioner,  soap,  razor,  deodorant,  and left my bedroom and bathroom a mess, along with damaging my dresser."

You are also brought through the side of the building to avoid the concierge and doorman at 75 West End Towers.  In 90 minutes from booking, I tried to cancel through Airbnb directly.  It didn't happen, so I reached out to the host.  It was a mistake.  I explained my discomfort and he threatened my person if I were to expose his hustle to the management company Brodsky Organization.  I never stayed yet I am charged for a night and cleaning fee.

There should not be a fee for Covid. There also shouldn’t be a penalty when a host scams you. If I book my reservation at 4pm and the host accepts my payment but then at 4:50pm rejects my reservation, I shouldn’t be charged a ducking (I’m using ducking but it’s meant to start with an F - apparently freedom of speech isn’t a thing anymore) fee nor should my money be in the lockjaw grip of air bnb. This site will steal from you and hold your money for as long as they chose to. I’m done. I’ve used this app and experienced a positive outcome maybe once. All the failed efforts on the air bnb end are enough to prevent me from ever using this app again. I’ve stayed in hotels my entire life, and never had a single problem like the nightmare air bnb has caused on multiple occasions. Dear Air bnb, this is a vacation app, correct? Or at least a leisurely travel app? Right?! So why the suck (suck with an F) does a vacation travel app create more work and stress than my actual job??"

We’ve used Airbnb so many times and the only bad comment I would have said is the photos are always misleading. They make the property’s look far bigger than what they are. However we’ve always had a nice enough stay so left positive reviews on their site. Today however I get a message from a booking I made to go away with my family in two days time, informing me that the people who were meant to leave on Sunday are still there. That they requested to stay longer and even though we have PAID and they’ve already taken that money from my bank, that we would need to change apartments. I asked why this was allowed when we had already booked in advance and paid and wasn’t given any real response to this even though I asked multiple times. I was shown two other apartments from another company they said, both of which were not at all like we had booked, they were cheaper but we booked a certain type of apartment and wanted like for like. This is the second time this has happened to us with Airbnb. The first time we were asked to change as key workers needed to extend their stay, we happily agreed to do that. However this time there was no reason for this host to of allowed our booking to go because they agreed on someone else extending their stay even though they’d took our money. I now have a day to try and find somewhere else to go with my young children. Completely unprofessional of this company run by Hazel in Basingstoke and we will not use them again. When Booking is cancelled by the host it doesn’t allow you to leave a review which again isn’t very helpful to future customers as they can’t get to see how many times they do this."

If you have a problem, and need to talk to customer service, there is NO service. We had a guest want to cancel his reservation, but he wanted us to cancel it to avoid the late cancellation fee. We said we could not do that because we would be penalized. The next thing we know, the booking is cancelled, and it says WE cancelled. We did not. Now we owe airbnb $100. We got $0 from the reservation, and they blocked the dates so we couldn’t book with anyone else. We are out over $500. Somehow the guest hacked our account or called pretending to be us and canceled. When you call airbnb they do not verify identity over the phone. SO unprofessional! I know many hosts who are very upset and ready to boycott or leave airbnb permanently. New hosts beware! You are just a money-maker for them. They do not care about you. Protect yourself."

I paid £810 when I booked, with a further £645 to be paid by 31st July. On May 18th, David, the ""superhost"" messaged me and asked if I would still be going or if I wanted to change the booking for later on in the year. I replied that I was waiting to see how the pandemic would pan out but also wouldn't be able to go later this year. I asked David what his coronavirus cancellation policy was. This was his reply:'After 48 hours, my cancellation policy is 50% refund typically. For corona virus related bookings I try to either reschedule, or offer a 75% refund.. With 25% off their next booking if they do decide to stay another time.'I messaged back and said we will book with him next year. He then told me to cancel my booking, he'll refund 50% and will then send on the remaining 25% to me. So I cancelled the booking. Out of the £810 I paid, I have been refunded £296. Airbnb's customer service is abissmal. It is apparent they are happy to allow hosts to message guests, tell them blatant lies and scam money from them. The faceless Airbnb is as corrupt as David the ""supehost"" of St. Ann's road townhouse, killarney, co. Kerry, who also coincidentally managed to fill my cancelled weeks extremely rapidly! Avoid booking David's townhouse at all costs, unless you want a lying scam artist as your host!"

I booked a week's accommodation for myself travelling solo.  The host, who had very good ratings, had a new apartment which looked nice in the photos, was reasonably priced and available with 6 days to go near Naples in Italy.  I arrived at the apartment to find that the photos were utterly deceptive. The area was rough, the host wasn't present, the address details weren't complete and it took nearly 25 minutes of phone calls and waiting before I finally got in. I was frankly shocked by what greeted me.  It was dark and dingy. The ""kitchen area"" was a totally unusable space with no windows in the corridor between bedsit rooms and stairwell. No toilet seat and my the view from my bed was up into the bathroom.  I phoned Airbnb to see if I could get alternative accommodation.  The first agent I spoke to said he'd put me through to the correct department and I was cut off.  I phoned again.  The lady I spoke to next time was very sympathetic but again said she couldn't deal with my issue. She couldn't put me through to the correct department as they were busy but said she'd put down all my details and that someone would contact me. That was on 24th August.I had to find alternative accommodation at gone 7pm at night as I didn't feel safe where I was. The host did look for alternative accommodation for me and sent photos but by that time I'd lost trust in him as his previous photos were so far out.  I didn't stay in the ""accommodation"" at all.It is now 4th September and I've heard nothing. I sent another long message a few days detailing my issues and sending photos of what greeted me. Not a word in response.As a previously loyal and regular Airbnb guest (with plans to become a host also), I am utterly disillusioned and will not ever be giving them my business again."

We had planned a 3 day trip in mid August 2020 to Mammoth Lakes, CA right before the week the schools were opening. One of the host told us that she would be able to host us only for 2 nights instead of 3 after we had made the reservation. We cancelled the reservation. The host refunded us all the money but Airbnb never refunded us the service fee which was $77. Even though we cancelled the moment the host told us about the situation.  We booked another condo for the same dates. After driving for 5 hours with 2 young kids, when we reached the condo it wasn’t cleaned. And to give you a little more insight, we were in contact with the host a day before our reservation, asking the host questions about check-in etc. When we messaged the host, he said he was extremely sorry and had forgotten to update his cleaning crew about our reservation. Which is extremely u professional, given that we had been in contact with him a day before. Anyways, the host told us to cancel the reservation through the app, which we did. The host refunded all the money he owed but we were never refunded $108 for service fee of Airbnb. It’s almost been 3 weeks to a month since the cancellations and I am going back and forth with the hosts and Airbnb for the refund. Airbnb won’t take any calls as they are experiencing high volume of calls, they only take calls for reservations that are less than 72 hours away. Which I think is extremely pathetic and unprofessional. Their support team online is even worse. I tried to message the support team several times about my issue and explained in detail why I needed to be refunded the service fee, they very conveniently close the cases without resolving the issues or even responding back. Airbnb owes me $185 for both the reservations and is not refunding. Pathetic pathetic customer service and a rip off company."

They allow guests to destroy your property and not follow the rules you have for your house with no repercussions. They even go as far as to let your guests leave a review after you request payment for replacing a mattress or whatever the issue was...of course they gave all 1's...so, if you only have a 4 star rating and then the problem guest gives you all 1's it brings your rating down to below the mandatory 3.6 Airbnb requires you to have. Airbnb will then shut your listing down and cancel your future bookings. Forcing the home owner to lose business. So, as a host, you try to contact them and 4 weeks later, you still have not gotten a response from Airbnb. Don't do business with them.

No-one has contacted us with any feedback. I cannot even say bad customer support because there actually isn't any. Please do not support these guys anymore!

Once loyal customer never booking again!I needed to cancel an upcoming trip and went through the prompts to cancel the trip. On the last screen, it redirected me to a blank screen and froze. Tried 4 different browsers none worked. Upon refresh the trip still showed that it was booked. Tried to contact airbnb and their automated phone system would not pick up but directed me to chat with their support. It’s been 24 hours and I heard nothing except from a self-described “junior” Airbnb worker who could do nothing to either help me cancel or rectify the situation. I’m using booking.com from now on as bad as that platform is at least the cancel button works."

Should you for any reason need to cancel or change your plans, you can forget about you money.  The cancellation policy is ridiculous by any means, you stand to lose the whole lot as soon as you book.   I guess they don’t really care about a long term vision, since I’m never booking with them again.  If you need assistance you’re doomed they’ll  just ghost you till you give up.  They’ve become money hungry without the services, they have no way of monitoring home cleanliness or safety.  Don’t throw your hard earned money at them."

However, we have offered refunds when customers had to sadly cancel their events. I am extremely displeased with the policy of Airbnb as it relates to COVID cancellations. First the put it on the host, then they say if you have to meet their COVID requirements, then the host agrees to a refund but they still only give you a “credit”. So the host is not made whole and the customer has no idea when they may possibly be able to use this credit. So a group of 10 girls who had to cancel a bachelorette party is left with no refund. Not a good way to keep a customer."

I just had a place I booked for 3 days. When I arrived to unit the smell of wet dog was unbearable. I smelled the mattress in room and knew it was unrepariable. I called Airbnb phone support right away. They told me not to worry and to leave they will help me get another room, mind you this was 4pm out of state. I messaged several airbnb people and found another spot 1 hr away. Airbnb now will not give me any refund for this. I'm really dissapointed that I followed their protocol for leaving. The host even told me to cancel but I said Airbnb will take care of it ""They said"". I would not use them any more of they can't rectify this matter. I mean really, who wants to sleep in ""the dog's room"" when guest are not there."

For the 2nd time payment for my trip was drafted out of an account that was not my default account. Last time I was able to get it fixed quickly. This time I can’t speak to anyone on the phone because the trip is two weeks away and the phone system kicks me off. I get no response to messaging customer support either. Maybe this isn’t a big deal for some people but I have a mortgage payment due tomorrow and was not planning on almost $400 coming out of my account unauthorized. I just need the refund and the payment taken out of my default account that it should have been taken from the first time!

We checked in on Friday evening as directed and went to bed early after driving for 20 hours to rach Denver. At 10:00 PM that night I received an email from Airbnb stating "" I'm reaching out to inform you that Airbnb has determined we are unable to support reservation HM4C33AXNH with Effortless Stay Thompson and will be moving forward with canceling it"". When I saw this the following morning I reached out to Airbnb indicating that we would not move out having just arrived. The repsonse was ""Air bnb experienced a technical issue that resulted in dozens of our reservations being cancelled. We are currently waiting to hear from them on when the issue will be resolved. "" This was followed by an email that stated, ""You do not have to leave or check out early. ""The following day I recieved another email from Airbnb that said, ""Airbnb has determined that we are unable to support this reservation, and will be moving forward with cancelling it. If check-in has already happened, we ask that the checkout process begin as soon as possible.Please reply to this email to confirm that you've received this message, and provide an estimate of how long you'll need to complete checkout. We will follow up with your host once you've confirmed that you have checked out.""Again I responded that we were not vacating the unit to which I receive this response, "" While in accordance with our privacy policy, we are unable to provide specific details, Airbnb has been made aware that there may be a potential breach of our terms of service by your host. We have taken proactive steps and decided to cancel the reservation.I understand your frustration and I want to stress again that these situations are very rare. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and they are only made in the best interest of our community and maintaining a safe, trusted marketplace. But, again, we must stress that this reservation will have to be cancelled.""My wife and I had traveled from Atlanta Georgia to Denver and my son, his wife and my grandson had traveled from San Francisco. It was nealry impossible for us to find other accomodations without spending additional funds on top of the monies paid in advance to Airbnb. On the 22nd I receive an email that stated "" We have just cancelled this reservation, and you should have received an email which confirms this. Airbnb protections are no longer in place and you are at your own risk by staying.""They did call that day and left a call back number. When I called the help center i waited for on hold for nealry 45 monutes and no one ever picked up. In retrospect, the unit was not as advertised missing items indicted in the offering. The carpets were stained and the living room chnadelier cover was sitting on the floor when we arrived. I have noted to Airbnb that this was my first and last rental with their company."

Then they got big and now they just look at dollar signs. Fees have gone up ridiculously customer service has sank to an all time low (notice that the bulk of reviews in 2020 all give one stars and if there were a possibility of zero stars most would chose that).I wrote the founder last year with reasons why they are getting bad reviews and losing hosts and guests. No response so I sent it a second time with no response. I have called customer service every week or 2 times a week about the flaws in their system. When asked a question every agent says they are not sure or give a run around about the issue. Do Not expect straight answers as they have none. They say they will look into an issue and then send a form letter that has nothing to do with what you have asked. If you have a guest that as requested a reservation and you want to compensate them for the rising fees you can not do that because the special off button is not there. You know why? They want you to accept the request for the full amount and then go back and credit the guest for the discount. But does Airbnb then apply their 14% fee to the new lower guest price. No they do not. That my friend is exactly why the 'special offer' button is not on the request page even though I have asked them about it a dozen times. It is all about the greed.

It is impossible to get an actual human being to help and their so-called Help pages are no help at all. I am thoroughly disgusted by the way I am being treated.

My sister has brain cancer, and my husbands work is going to make him quarantine for 2 weeks after, therefore, we canceled.  They gave me $35.00 back when I paid over $580.  Their policy on their website tells you to keep checking back for their ""COVID Cancellation Policy"" changes.  On August 15, they posted that the hosts cancellation policy will apply now, which means I am due the whole deposit.  On August 15, I emailed Airbnb, because you cannot talk to ANYONE when you call.

Airbnb & the host ""Olivia"" are both negligent and slow to respond. House was filthy. The owner tried to bribe me not to write a bad review about how dirty the house was. Later, we also found out that there was bed bug infestation. Here is how the events unfolded:1. Upon check-in the owner was not wearing a mask. We felt concerned so we went grocery shopping for 1.5hrs to let the air in the house settle. When we came in we opened all windows to let the house air out.2. Guideline Instructions were dirty with crud all over it. House was dirty. Light switches were oily. Kitchen was dirty. Oil was all over stove. Found splashes of feces in the toilet. Boot prints on the floor. Heavy dust accumulated on surfaces. I have photo/video evidence.3. I let the owner know. She offered to come back to clean the toilet. I said no because I didn't want her to come in without a mask. 4. Owner pleaded with me not to write a bad review. She said it was her livelihood. She said people make mistakes sometimes and offered to drop off bleach and a sponge and a ""treat"".5. Owner dropped off bleach, sponge, and gave me $40 credit on Airbnb that I did not ask for.6. We cleaned the house and the bathrooms. We washed the towels. House was dirty. 7. I offered her advice to use checklists not to miss any cleaning. She said it was a good idea. Mind you, the listing was under Airbnb's ""Enhanced Clean Protocol"". She should have been following the protocol guidelines and checklists. When we talked to her about checklists she said, ""That's a good idea."" That led us to believe that she has never made any effort to follow the “Enhanced Clean” protocols. House wasn't even normal Pre-Covid-19 clean.8. 3rd Friend comes on Saturday and sleeps in 3rd bedroom. She is pregnant and in her first trimester. I woke up to her screaming with bugs all over her. She had to strip down and get into the shower to get them off of her. Bed was infested with bedbugs. I'm afraid that the stress and continued nightmares of bed bugs could lead to a higher chance of miscarriage.9. Called Host who did not answer. Called Airbnb.10. Washed clothes put them in bags. We left luggage because we found bed bugs on/in them and we could not wash them in high heat before we left (3 luggage). 11. Owner calls us back and doesn't sound concerned. She said that she has twins and is sleep deprived??? I ended the call because we were too busy cleaning/washing and quarantining our things.12. We left bachelorette decor on one wall, pool floaties, and some food in the fridge. The rest of the garbage we bagged up and left in the informal kitchen/dining area.13. Left key in owner's designated area.We would like the public to know that they are renting at their own risk and may contract Covid-19, among other things like bed bugs, since Airbnb does not police or ensure that their Hosts are following their claimed “Standards” and “Enhanced Clean” protocols. Airbnb is in the process of refunding the stay. We are still seeking compensation for alternate hotel stay and luggage that we had to leave behind for health reasons since there were bed bugs on/in them. We would also like compensation for our pregnant friend's mental anguish and general health well-being. Since an infestation of that size likely started some time ago, Airbnb should do their due-diligence to contact recent renters of the listing to let them be aware that there were bed bugs in the house. Since Airbnb is aware and has proof of how this specific Host does not comply with their standards, we would also like this host and all of her listings to be suspended indefinitely from Airbnb to show that Airbnb is not being negligent. She did not follow the “Enhanced Clean” protocols that she attested to, tried to bribe us to not write a bad review, had a bed bug infestation, and did not show concern for the situation we were in. The listing was removed while the host treats for bed bugs, but the host is continuing to rent another property close by. Here is her Host Profile link: www.airbnb. com/users/show/35991542"

READ THIS BEFORE BOOKING WITH AIRBNB!,"Airbnb really did a number on us...Their policy promises a full refund if something unexpected happens that prevents you from going on your vacation. They call it “extenuating circumstances”. Sounds good, right? Well, no.We booked a vacation with some friends to go to a near by beach town. About 6 hours drive, 5 guests. In the evening before our vacation one of guests tested positive to Covid-19, which immediately sent another 3 guests into quarantine for meeting her the day before (according to CDC guidelines). So, at the time of check-in, 4 out of 5 guests were sick / quarantined because of Covid-19.    What do you think Airbnb did? Did we get our money back (2k)?Of course not. Airbnb’s official answer? “The fifth guest was fine so he could have gone on this vacation on his own”.I WISH I WAS KIDDING.According to Airbnb, it makes sense for a single guest (out of 5) to drive 6 hours on his own to a huge 2 bedroom apartment that was meant for 5 people and spend 4 nights alone on the couch while worrying about his friends who are sick with coronavirus at home. WELL PLAYED, Airbnb.I will definitely think twice before booking with Airbnb ever again. THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES."

1792,Michael Dean,GB,1 review,"Monday, August 24, 2020, 07:21:00 AM",1,Entire house listing misleading,"Entire house listing misleadingBe aware that Air bnb have a dubious policy of allowing hosts to list their accommodation as Entire House even if it is shared with the host or other guests. As long as the host puts a one line note that they live in the property in the most obscure place on their listing you will not get a refund.We booked the entire house - 3 bedrooms for a couple and their two teenage daughters. We were arriving from South Africa after 36 hours of travelling. After delays we only arrived at 6pm at Heathrow. Another 2 hours travel to the house.On arrival 3 guests remained to complete check in while I went went to get groceries for our 2 weeks of self isolation (required by the government and the sole reason for booking the house.)Upon return from grocery shopping it was Found that the we were in fact Sharing the house with the host ( a middle aged man) who was occupying the 3rd bedroom. Leaving our teenage girls to share a double bed.Further more the hosts clothing was in the walk in wardrobe in the main room. He did offer to clear a rail but concerns for our privacy if he needed access to the wardrobe.Furthermore, the host showed us around explaining that he is a neat freak and very particular about his house. Rules such as placing foil in the oven each time you cook, using a tea towel to open the oven door to prevent making the glass. Food only to be consumed in the dining room. We did not feel comfortable sharing a home with a complete stranger with our teenage daughters. We had no choice but to leave immediately, returning with our friend to Surrey and find temporary hotel accommodation. This added 6 hours to our already exhausting international travel. When I approached the host regarding the booking being for the entire house he insisted that we were allowed access to the whole house so his listing was not incorrect. He suggested that a way to resolve the bedroom issue would be for him to sleep on the sofa. The booking clearly states ENTIRE HOUSE. Air bnb costumer service offered to book us alternative accommodation but expected us to pay again and said we were not entitled to a refund.Eventually after a week they offered 50% of the accommodation but refused to refund the cleaning fee and booking fee. The listing is not transparent and Air bnb are happy for this host to mislead people into paying for his Entire house"

I provided a doctor note dated within 14 days of cancellation per their policy. They are stating that my stay was booked after March 31, and isn't covered. This is what the extenuating circumstances are for covid and not a regular serious illness. They are acting stupid and of course there is no one I can talk to that can solve the problem. CS takes down info and forwards it. Airbnb doesn't care about the customer. You can bet that I will file a small claim in court if needed. I hope everyone else does the same. Be sure and request all court costs be included and paid by Airbnb. Its only $30 to file and you can do it online."

Please reach out to me as they don't let email addresses be published, I am using their automated system to our advantage by placing the info in this message by capitalizing the 2 words that are in ""it"" and ""it"" ends with 5341 and then add the server name after the ""at"".  The 2 words are combined to make one word with the numbers added after that word. The server rhymes with Whoo""Hoo"".BEACH - briefly, after working hard to reach Superhost status I had one client who had come to my island for a family event and booked my place.  Afterwards, they decided to stay with family but did not want that cancellation fee or the mark on their record.  Since they were getting in late, their plan was to stay at my place that night, find some made up complaints and get out of the rest of their booking.  And their plan worked well for them.  AirBnB totally supported them and yes, AirBnB also reached out to me like 1:30 am.....LIVING - Anyway, due to Covid19, I placed my place on hold (apparently till today) as I live here and can not risk someone infected coming into my home, especially as I have a 95 year old (healthy) father.They sent me an email yesterday to tell me that it was going live today.  Which I did not see till today after I got several inquiries about renting it.  I am right on the water and I can tell by the $ amounts they are saying I will earn that my winter rate is posted, hence the high number of inquiries.All the passwords I had do not work.  I have tried to get them to send me the link to reset the password 30+ times, no luck.  The booking requests are coming through but not AirBnB's password reset link. I can not email them as they insist you are logged in to contact them.  Which I can't do.  I tried calling them on one of two numbers (the other # is disconnected) I had for them from over a year ago as you can not find any phone number for them on their website, even though they say their contact page has their phone number.....I went in and created a new account and was finally able to get to a ""chat' with them, except they are too busy, they don't have anyone available for their ""live"" chat.  At the very beginning of my connecting with them as a host (2018), I could actually reach them.  This last year+ has been a joke.  I am such a busy person, stopping to mess with this is truly a pain and having to spend hours just to try to reach them, let alone resolve an issue is beyond costly to me.  For it to be impossible to get my password reset is unforgivable, that is a basic function for a company that  apparently wants to be 100% internet based.  The problem with these companies (Verizon is similar in time spent with no resolution, but at least I get live people), is they don't have to pay us back for our time trying to resolve our issues with their company.  Our time is ""free"" to them and costly to us.AirBnB treats their hosts with no respect so they can use a business model that saves them money not paying live people.  What they lose from unhappy clients, hosts and guests alike, has to be costing them more then they are saving but they must be happy enough with they're profits, they just don't care."

I rented a place for two weeks and had all kind of problems with the landlords such as heating etc. and complained to Airbnb in several occasions and also raised a case with them. I felt that they take the defence of the landlords even when clear evidence (messages exchanged with landlord) is against them. The landlord during some very cold days didn't want to provide heating for certain hours of the day and also a discount that we agreed prior booking which was discussed on the Airbnb messages wasn't applied. Even with all the evidence a refund of about 100 pounds wasn't provided and the customer service of Airbnb wasn't helpful at all.

1798,Brittney ,US,1 review,"Sunday, August 23, 2020, 02:06:12 PM",1,Worst customer support,"Worst customer support. There is no way to actually talk to a person. First I’ll describe the timeline of their support and then I’ll explain my specific experience. When you find a way to connect with support via messages, you wait a few weeks and then you get in touch with a “human” only to be passed to another “human.” You wait another couple of days. The new human ends up sending you conversation directly through your email instead of their messages. I believe I have a false charge on my account. Not only do they ignore you for weeks despite it being a pandemic, they also think it’s ok to automatically message you directly to your email without asking first. Money worries are a nightmare right now, Airbnb exacerbates it. I used Airbnb for work to book spaces. I am asked to supply information that they should already have, like do I have an Airbnb account? What is the charge and date of the charge even though I supplied it to them twice already while waiting my two weeks to reach a “human.” Do they not have access to previous messages? Then they told me *twice* that my faulty charge *must* be from a friend or family member. They didn’t even try helping. They didn’t even look up my charge. If they had, they would be able to say “ah yes, we apologize, it looks like another person used your card” or “we are sorry, it looks like that charge was erroneous. Let us help you.” They literally asked *me* to ask my friends and family instead of just giving me solid information. Then when I told them that nobody else made that charge, they replied back saying “we concluded based on our investigation that you need to ask your family and friends to see whether they used your card.” What? I was of course upset. Also they message you at 3 or 4 in the morning. I recommend just using good old fashioned hotels. If a business goes through such lengths to *blame* their customers for their problems and drag the conversation out over several weeks, then they clearly show that they do not care about “humans” and only money. Avoid Airbnb like the plague. They also charge too much for all their service and cleaning fees. Just go through people directly or an actual hotel."

I travelled to a city in Maharashtra recently and was stranded as the booking I had mage previously was not what I expected to be . I was travelling alone with my dog in tow and trying to book another place through air bnb it allowed me to book this property that I was about 30 mins away from for the same evening .. (mind you it was pouring and the roads were really bad to get one place from another) I was prompted to make a reservation using me card and the app confirmed that no money would be deducted till the host confirmed the booking ) but the money was deducted immediately So I started travelling towards the hosts place checking the status .. since I couldn’t drive and check the status I asked a friend to help out who got in touch with the air bnb helpline .. he was on chat continuously.. the customer service advisor Merielle said they would try and contact the host since I couldn’t see any host information then she confirmed that she would call me to cancel the booking since I was stranded Neither of which happened I waited for almost and hour during which my friend was as able to contact the host who said he hadn’t received a booking and so I decided I had to get another place. Meanwhile air bnb is still online with my friend I tried the cancellation through the app - it says host cancellation policy doesn’t allow refunds and to contact customer service And customer service on the phone is not reachable because of high wait time’s and I’m in the middle of nowhere So by the time I get another place to stay for the night and reach there and PAY the host calls me .. and says he cannot decline the booking request since they will charge a fee .. air bnb still hasn’t contacted !! now the host is convincing me to ask  refund from the property I have checked into and go to his I explained this through the next entire day to multiple advisors all of them said we can’t help you your case manager is “Jeremiah” and only get will help you He is contactable In the meantime the host bullies me saying if you cancel the Saturday booking I’ll refund it for you .. then he threatens saying I am trying to help you .. you are blocking my booking Air bnb writes to the host separately saying it’s his call so basically I’m really f ko importance to air bnb or the host .. not surprising at all I have been following up for 3 days now no one has called or refunded my money"

But Airbnb on the other hand don’t want to take any risk. Online business is all about confidence and trust and my trust in Airbnb and its hosts has nearly evaporated. I have repeatedly tried to support Aussie hosts and Airbnb indirectly through the COVID crisis but have been repeatedly slapped by hosts that refuse to take any risk expecting the customer to take 100% while hiding behind their cancellations policies. I am trying to stay positive and optimistic – planning ahead and while supporting good quality local destinations and providers and this is the cost to me as a “buyer”. Why should I take any risk from now on?I will not be taking all the risk and more or using Airbnb for that reason.Be warned.

They offer one price then once you have booked it they get in touch to request more money, as they have made a mistake (as Gianlucca of La Raccontasterie In Tuscan town of Capannoli did 4 weeks after we booked  - conf code HMXZ584KWN), or that it is under renovation and they could not therefore accept the booking request, but will send an alternative, which turns out to be the same property but at a much inflated price (yes I’m talking about you Marcella of Gallipoli with your “beach front house with sea view” situated on Via Gian Batista Vico in Gallipoli.Or the latest addition to the saga claims it’s his first reservation and he’s made a mistake and asked for more money after accepting the initial reservation. We did not accept his alteration request and instead stood firm and said he would need to cancel his end so we get a full refund if he was not happy with the reservation. He has since said he will honour the price as it was his mistake....but we can decide on the extra at the end of our stay.....interestingly it’s in the toe of Italy so I wonder if the familia will be round to “make us an offer we can’t refuse” we’re going to let the dice roll and see. But to AIR BNB, you appear to be failing to grip the situation with your service and a fall at this last hurdle and we will consider your portal once and for all a dead duck and will instead rely on the (only slightly) better reviewed Booking.com"

I am a traveling RN and stay in different places thru this company WEEKLY. Have always had great experiences. However I have never had customer services issues until recently. My family and I had planned a trip with 4 different families to take our kids to spend time together this summer, we picked out dates ahead of time and were set to go. BUT we unfortunately had positive COVID test in our group the week before we were suppose to leave. We did not quality for a refund thru Airbnb original refund policy but we did qualify for refund thru the extenuating circumstance policy since we had positive COVID. We sent in all documentation they requested upon requesting for a refund. We had already tried to get a refund thru the company called Evolve, a 3rd party company that used Airbnb to book out houses. We did not qualify for a refund thru them. This trip was planned for July 8-12 2020. I requested a refund on June 30th the day I found out people were testing positive in our group. I explained the situation and never heard anything back from either company until I reached out again. Airbnb finally responded to me on July 3 with an automated message after I spent hours on the phone with them thru Airbnb support stating they would send my information to the correct department. Our trip was schedule for the 8th. At that time I figured surely they will get back to me before we leave? I talked to someone on the phone again to ask that and they still responded with “your information has been sent to the correct department.” Finally on the night of July 7th I am still trying to contact them because I have heard nothing about if we would be granted the refund under the extenuating circumstances policy, although from what I read I thought we would. At this point we don’t know what to do because no one from Airbnb is responding to my messages, that our only option we thought was to go thru the 3rd party Evolve and try to push the dates back until I hear from Airbnb on the refund since we had less than 24 hour until our trip. And it was $1600. I move the dates to March 2021 and pick whatever dates I can find thinking at-least the other company won’t just pocket our money since they (Evolve) declined the refund but Airbnb should cover it due to COVID-19. I gave them the benefit of the doubt knowing they were behind on responding because of COVID19 and I work in healthcare so I totally understand how it has impacted everyone. I have tried getting ahold of Airbnb numerous times thru the app and have spoken to someone on the phone multiple times explaining the situation and checking for an update. Even been told they would call me back in 5-7 minutes after talking to evolve, then they never called me back. Today I finally get a phone call from someone in customer service telling me that since I changed the dates that I now do NOT qualify for a refund on this trip.. that if I wouldn’t of changed the dates then I could of gotten a refund. So I was suppose to expect Airbnb to refund me and wait SEVEN weeks after our vacation to get that confirmed. I am very disappointed with the customer service I have received from this company. I understand things happen and I was okay with waiting till they were caught up on their end. But for them to turn this around on ME, because of their poor customer service.. because THEY were behind.. because THEY couldn’t get someone to respond to me when I sent in the documents the lady requested on the phone. Who couldn’t confirm if we qualified for a refund or not at that time. Could only tell me that my issue was sent to the correct department and that “surely someone would get ahold of me before the trip dates.” Today when I asked to speak to a supervisor on the phone because I am clearly upset about how this situation has been handled. The guy states “okay a supervisor will call you in approximately 7-14 days” then hangs up on me. Please people if you decide to use this company make sure you know the customer service is not good, they won’t respond to you when you are in a difficult situation. And when they do they won’t take responsibility for THEIR mess up. 100% of this could of been avoided if they took responsibility for them being in the wrong during this situation. It’s not hard to be a decent human. Everyone makes mistakes, but their actions afterwards is what shows the type of person/company they are."

All what they care about is money.They didn't even ban or remove that listing and refused to give me compensation for having bad exp coz of their poor job.So don't expect them to protect you,  you should cover your ass yourself - take photos/vid upon moving in and moving out, so you have proof that you didn't do anything wrong.Host definitely didn't expect me to have such photos, so she sat on her ass and didn't ask for compensation anymore, after i provided all photos and reported her to the airbnb.I won this case, but i couldn't feel protected or safe on airbnb after that exp so i stopped using this site and cannot recommend it."

I have been a loyal customer of Airbnb since they started, no issues ever, my reviews as a guest are impeccable. I had to cancel a booking just now due to a COVID quarantine. The host agreed a cancellation minus the Airbnb service charge but Airbnb have charged the full amount to my card and it is impossible to contact them via any channel and the gist is not accepting any responsibility. Note that Airbnb take no responsibility for making sure that hosts clean and sanitise properties between rentals.  Why not? Surely a socially responsible company would insist on this before accepting bookings and if none is forthcoming guests would have the right to cancel a booking? Airbnb are promoting very unsafe and irresponsible behaviours. A hotel has more responsibility for  ensuring guests safety. My strong advice is don’t even think about booking a property or experience with Airbnb at the moment."

The host informed me that they don’t get paid until the guest checks in. I contacted AirB&B for months(April-August 2020). No resolution was ever offered. Customer service totally ignores what the host told me. I even sent a screen shot of the messages.  AirB&B said their “final” answer is to go to the host. It seems that they lack understanding of the issue. Anyway, book with caution!!  I have been a Loyal customer but received zero support."

Upon cancelling was not refunded the service fee. I raised a ticket with airbnb customer support since their phone line only deals with reservation issues and disconnects you however 18 days later I still have not received a response. I've replied to this ticket daily asking for an update. Especially in the current environment withholding a refund can be at incredible financial hardship and it's unacceptable to wait over 2 weeks to even have the ticket acknowledged. Such terrible customer service that needs to be addressed. Refunds need to correspond with your advertised policy, I should not have to reach out to get my money back."

Orders by our President. When this happened I contact my hosts and cancelled reservations on March 12 but did not receive my $450.00 refund. At the time I didn’t understand since AirBNB posted a message saying if anyone traveling on March 14-July 2020 can receive a full refund. My trip started April 9th. I waited for a while and never saw the money. Finally I got a hold of a person (many failed attempts) and they told me I couldn’t get my money back because I cancelled on March 12th and if I cancelled on Mar 14th they would have given me all my money back. My actual trip was in April so I was floored. I told them I cancelled it after the President announced the shutdown and had proof when emailing the hosts. They said they would not budge. I’m out $450.00. I will never use AirBNB again. They do not do the right thing. I can see by the reviews I’m not the only one dealing with the nightmare of AirBNB. They will be out of business soon I’m sure when more and more companies who have a better customer service take over. Do not use this company for traveling. I have talked to others who had issues, one being a past host I wanted to book with again and they told me dealing with Airbnb was such a nightmare they dropped them and went with another company to do their business with."

The only way to communicate with Airbnb is via internet, nonetheless, they are able to contact you via phone.  But you can't contact anyone related to claims via phone.  This has interrupted my life, being a RN during this pandemic. I call 2-3 times a week with no return calls related to the claim.  I do understand Covid crisis is going on, hell I and my coworkers are living it daily.  I also know Airbnb has laid off people, but I don't understand why my emails and calls have gone unanswered."

Airbnb has done zero to assist.  We are going on 2 months of no resolution.  I have spent countless hours trying to speak to a human - they continue to only send auto responses.  I will not stop until I receive my full refund.  Airbnb will also not allow you to leave a review if you cancel your reservation which is why you will only see 5 star reviews for this property.

The fact is, you can almost never reach them by phone to talk with someone about an issue. On top of that they charge both the guest and the owner/manager to use their services. So, the cost to a guest to use them for booking a property are generally significantly higher then if you would book directly with the home owner or management company. Also, guests and owner/managers cannot communicate directly with each other until after the booking is completed. That does not build any confidence or trust between the parties that matter, which is the guest and the owner/manager."

Like property agents they need to work for the host or like a booking middleman work with the guest. But it seems that they work for both and this is where Airbnb falls over because you can never satisfy both. Customer support was not great before Covid-19 but now its much worse and practically non-existant. Being a host for many years on the platform I have had many encounters with the support team. They are good at basic requests but I would say 70% of the time they were unhelpful and too rigid in what seems like a scripted way on anything other than saying hello. When you try to engage them they come accross as robots and passively antagonistic. Instead of support you just get a headache. Bottom line is that you are genuinely on your own in dealing with issues. Airbnb has the power to ignore anything it pleases and theres nothing you can do about it. Property professionals are required to belong to an ombudsman or redress scheme (at least in the UK) but this comany has not done so.  There is a lot of hot air in Airbnb and not much else.

After our property security witnessed a guest committing an illegal act on our property, our condo association charged us as owners a $500 violation fee. Per Airbnb, when the guest refused to pay this, we went through their Resolution Center to request payment from the guest.  I submitted documentation with my original request proving the incident.  Nothing happened.  Over the past month, we have called Airbnb support (which turns out to be a dispatch service only) multiple times, even escalating our ticket to urgent status twice.  Still no response.  There is no way to contact the Airbnb staff who can actually help us, and no one is responding to our multiple requests for help.  Now, in addition to the $500 our condo association is charging us, they have added a late fee.  The takeaway here is do NOT expect any kind of support whatsoever from Airbnb, should you have any issues with renters.  You're on your own."

Now before I start, this has nothing to do with hosts or stays, but absolutely EVERYTHING to do with customer service and how Airbnb handles problems and issues when they arise. To begin, I booked a place in Birch Bay, WA (keep in mind I booked almost 3 months in advance). About 2-3 hours from where I live (depending on traffic). It’s my husbands birthday and birch bay is his absolute favorite place in the world to visit. Airbnb sends us an email saying “pack your bags! Your trip is here! Have a great time!” You know, the usual email you get the day of your trip. So we arrive around 6pm (thanks to traffic) and check our email to find out how to check in our house (like many, it used a lock box) but what’s this? No lock box on the door? Hmm, that’s strange. So we look all around and find no lockbox. I send a message to the host- no response. So then I call the host who answers very quickly and then proceeds to tell me that she cancelled the reservation because one of the owners had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and that Airbnb should have cancelled the reservation and alerted me of the change. Well as everyone who has read thus far, the only thing Airbnb told me was to PACK MY BAGS BECAUSE MY TRIP IS READY! So I’m seething at this point because it’s pouring rain, it’s dinner time, and we have no place to go other than the drive back home. So I hang up and proceed to call Airbnb. Well, if you have not had issues with Airbnb before, you may not know of their 400 million rabbit holes they have in place when you dial their customer service. “Press 1 for this, press 2 for that, press 4564848484 for this...” and so on. Well after about 20 minutes of falling for their phone tree BS, I’m finally talking to an actual human, only barely because this guy hardly speaks English. I BARELY caught his name! (Robinson?) Now, I really try not to yell at customer service employees. They have a job to do and do what their told. It’s not their fault for the problem I’m having and I know it’s absolutely not fair to take it out on them. However, Airbnb put me on hold about 15 times playing calming music (nice try Airbnb, but it did not calm me down) and told me in about 59 different ways that I’m getting a refund. WELL NO SHIZ IM GETTING A DAMN REFUND BUT HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO COMPENSATE FOR MY PARTY GETTING STUCK WITH NO PLACE TO STAY AND NOT LETTING ME KNOW MY RESERVSTION WAS CANCELLED UNTIL I GET TO THE DAMN PLACE!?!?! Not once was an apology made for my inconvenience, no efforts were made to compensate for this HUGE inconvenience and mistake made on THEIR END!! Just over and over “yes ma’am you’re absolutely getting your refund!” Not to mention, they told me my refund won’t hit for another 2 weeks!!! They couldn’t even help with a rebook so we weren’t stranded, so we had to fork out more of our own money just to find a place to sleep. And of course, the people who “handle these situations” wasn’t taking calls (WTH!?). Customer service just told me to write to Resolutions which is an online inbox basically where you complain about the issues they don’t give zero fluffs about. Super cool. Moral of the story, hosts and vacation spots good, customer service VERY BAD. Reserve at your own risk."

However since Covid19 everything goes down the drain. I had booked in Feb a stay in Canterbury UK in July. The host had a strict policy, but we were not expecting to not go. However due to Covid, we had to cancel on 30-06, in agreement with the host. We expected to receive a refund under their Covid19 policy or at least the 50% we had a right to, from the normal cancellation policy. I requested a refund over their resolution center and since then there is not a single info or communication. I learned from the host that till today he has not even received the refund authorization request, that should come from Airbnb. Calling, chatting, mailing, not a single respons. For me they have turned into thieves, I will never use them again. And I will advise everyone I know to not use them anymore.It is a big shame as it was a really good concept, now gone wrong."

Even though I was assured that if I was cut off they would phone me back nobody did. We had already paid a large deposit and to make matters more frustrating they today took the balance from my card. They are a complete rip off with zero courtesy or support for their customers.Update. After throwing my toys out I now have received a full refund. So credit where its due but its a shame I had to fight to get the right response

I have tried this about a half a dozen times and not ever received a call back. I think this company is taking ruthless advantage of the coronavirus situation by laying off more people, this  not attending to the needs of hosts, and probably the needs of guests.

There is 0 verification process in place. They don’t check a home is available to be listed.

1887,Stephi Ess,GB,2 reviews,"Tuesday, August 4, 2020, 09:27:35 AM",1,Bride wedding postponed and no refund from Air bnb.,"Due to the impact of Covid-19, my wedding in October has had to be cancelled and rearranged for next year. I had made the booking for the sole purpose of accommodating guests who were flying over to attend my wedding. Accordingly, those guests will not be coming to the country and thus the accommodation is no longer required. Ultimately the circumstances are not my making and are completely outside my control. I wish the situation were different but unfortunately there is nothing that can be done because of the pandemic. I understand Airbnb has a cancellation policy and has indeed implemented an extenuating circumstances policy to cover bookings ‪until 20 August‬. However my booking has been impacted in exactly the same way as the bookings that your extenuating circumstances policy covers, in that it is no longer possible to stay at the accommodation due to Covid-19.  I have been contacting the Airbnb support team since MARCH and still in August I am no further forward. Given the difficulties suffered by everyone involved in the wedding, especially those due to stay at the accommodation, who have had to cancel or reschedule flights at significant cost, I had hoped that Airbnb, as a company can empathise with the circumstances and apply some common sense to the situation by allowing us to cancel without penalty. I even attached an email confirmation from the venue as confirmation of wedding being cancelled but still not enough and no response since last week. I understand this is a very difficult time for everyone. However, I am so disappointed at the lack of empathy and common sense in regards to this issues that I have been chasing the support team about since March."

In vicedo. The house looked great and had a flexible cancellation policy. the gobernment had just announced that we could travel in Spain so wanted to spend time with the family in the forest....Some time before the date of check in - there was an unexpected Covid situation in the area where the house was located and the government confined the whole area on 6th of july - this can be checked in La vanguardia - date of 6th July - confinamiento - a marinaThat meant that I could NOT arrive to the house. I cancelled through Airbnb and the landlord was super kind. However Airbnb told me that this was not a Force major event according to their policies. That I should have cancelled 14 days in advance.... 3rd of July. ...So it means that the fact that I can not reach the house because the police is not allowing cars to enter or exit is NOT a force major situation....Be very careful when booking through Airbnb because they will not return their fees.

Bushwa! The cabin wasn't cleaned and even had toe nails on the bedside table, someone else's soap in the shower, dirty kitchen and tub and the hottub outside was low, dirty, and the light inside didn't work and the lid was old and extremely heavy to lift. They did come back and clean a second time but I left a few things to see if they would be cleaned and they were not. Even found a prevoius guests' shirts under the edge of the bed. Asked for a refund and have been given the run around by Airbnb and no response from the hosts. No - I'm sorry - or - how can we make this up to you. The fire extinguisher in the cabin had never been inspected and was probably 10-15 years old. Once I brought that up, it was replaced after the cleaning. At least that might have done so good."

We went to cancel our booking, with over three months’ notice, and were told we would only get $67 back from our $583 deposit.

Said wording changes once you book, and only then does it reveal you're not getting your service fee back whereas before it implies you get everything back. By comparison, booking's free cancellation policy is entirely clear and has never failed me.

This particular location should be a one-nighter when desperate Pros: Decent views of downtown, not so much the river.  Cons:  1. Check-in: This was the most convoluted check-in to airbnb yet. The hosts made it sound so simple...just check in with the concierge and you get a key, done. First off, this is a hotel-type building which accommodates vacation type rentals not just from airbnb. A small sign tells you to go to the right to check-in. You put your information in an ipad then the 'concierge' hands you a woeful stack of towels (they charge for extra) +/- a key. If your rental has smartlock then the host texts you the code. Well after waiting in line and finishing with the concierge, I got up to the apartment and code didn't work. I had to call (after no response to text) for the host to reset the lock. So yeah, I was already irritated 2. No microwave or coffee pot. Per the host 'We have never had that, what made you think we did?' Good point, but you do realize even average hotels have those somewhere right?  3. Cleanliness- Gosh that carpet was filthy. Dead bugs on window sills still trapped by cobwebs.  4. WIFI- slowest Wifi yet I tell you. Basically, you get a code to a network shared by virtually all guests in the building (and it’s a big building with many rooms) 5. Kitchen: Yup, super basic. Didn't even have a paring knife. How are you supposed to prep food? Especially right now when it’s safer to prepare your own food. Also, the kitchen light only seemed to work only half the time 6. Living room: Aside from filthy carpet and floors, remote wasn't working. The TV uses a regular antenna (with only one half functional), so little options on what to watch. Also, the signal (which gave out multiple times) determines what you can watch if any. Also no drapes...had to be careful stepping out of that bathroom or bedroom.  7. Bedroom - there is a lamp for lighting, no overhead. This lamp definitely needs to be updated. Additionally, while I like it cool when I sleep, that AC in the bedroom was blowing something fierce.  8.  The hosts....It seems that Bluff City Stays handles multiple properties and this one is likely low on the totem pole. Based on the  responses i got, I felt like I was dealing with a corporation and not individuals. This is a warning to all future guests: if you have a change of plans no matter how pressing or unexpected requiring a change of your reservation Bluff City Stays will not reimburse you. I repeat, no matter what happens if you book for X days you pay for X days. Imagine if you book for a month and had an emergency, guess what, they'll keep your money period. Buyer Beware.  These are not the only hosts who do this, so tread carefully with AirbnbLocation: Oh I nearly forgot this one. This is essentially what you're paying for. Pre-pandemic it makes some sense. However, in a pandemic its poor choice. First off, you are sharing a building with hundreds of other people. Using the same elevator they are. When you venture out, especially if female don't expect to walk in peace."

To my horror, I have discovered upon arrival that booking did not exist by the address given in the direction instructions and the host refused to communicate. The three neighbors from different houses nearby were confused by the idea of letting services and I asked them to call to the owner of the house when he confirmed he did not provide letting services, I had to quickly cancel the booking and book a new one as it was late. When I have written a complaint to Airbnb they said they were just a third party. Had somewhat similar experience earlier but the host came clean before I moved in and said he would understand if I cancel my booking. The platform does not worth the fees it charges. Much useless."

Their final decision was that we did not report the problem immediately and therefore would not be eligible for a refund. Am I missing something here?

Try and find a phone number or if get through on chat you get a reply someone will come back in 24-48 hours. when they do they do nothing except to say the ""system"" doesn't allow it and when you explain you are operating as told to they just go....let me get back to you and more repeat of the same. If put in the exact town and available dates for your property it regularly doesn't appear on platform. I've found a cheat that get you to appear in the bookings algorithm - but I should just appear anyway. When you and the guest have spent ages messaging each other to be patient and sort - they will still charge both the guest and the host their fee for all the issues they have caused."

The hostel wasn't even a hostel, but a converted office building. The hosts were rude, screwing a cabinet shut while I was there where guests had stored their things. There were roaches all over the place. There was a torched car in the parking lot and fights in the parking lot that police were called for. When I bring this up to the company they tell me the host doesn't control those things and will not be held responsible.

How can a review be considered great if their besties are writing them? Sadly, I rated the host 5 stars after my stay but now, I regret it. It looks like hosts will do anything, like fake good reviews and fake good pictures to get a booking...and money. My host did not seem to care anything but my money.I bothered to research the hosts social media because something felt wrong after my stay. I  did not feel welcome and by day 3 or 4, the host stopped engaging in any polite greetings and would scurry out of the room if I approached. I never did anything wrong and he left me a positive guest review. It was super awkward. The host put nicer pics that were not accurate about various places inside the home. I even got a different room than the one I thought I was getting! And this is supposed to be a superhost?! It is shockingly bad! I feel like I failed a bit to warn future guests about spending money there. I will never see them again in my life and hope karma does it's job.

I would have left the booking, however, under guidance by the team through the support centre, I was advised to cancel it and apply for extenuating circumstances for consideration. I was told by a staff member by the name of Jackson that as the dates of my travel were not currently covered, to contact again after May 1 and that way Airbnb staff will then be able to assist me if the dates had changed. Come May, the dates did indeed had changed and upon contacting the support centre, I was told that I no longer was able to obtain a refund as I had cancelled - a move their staff had told me to do!

Our replacement staycation once things in the UK opened up was a week's stay in Oxford to explore the area and chill out in a nice comfortable place. Unfortunately the 2 Bedrom house in Oxford describes as ""Sleek & Stylish 2BR Home"" was far off the mark. We checked the lates reviews to ensure the place had a great cleanliness rating but unfortunately this wasn't good enough or accurate enough. Not only were both the front & back gardens a mess but the cleanliness of the kitchen made us decide immediately we had to cancel as we could no possibly stay and relax in this place. The kitchen had a bad odour and there was food crumbs on the floor indicating poor cleanliness. When we checked the oven we nearly puked as there were thick grease stains, burnt food crumbs and some of the metal was rusted, which according to the company who managed the property was ""normal"" for a used oven. There was also a large spider web with an insect in one of the corners of the living room which apparently can appear within minutes as the place was fully cleaned and prepared for us. To be fair the bedroom were acceptable and ensuite looked good as per the pictures online but the state of the kitchen, overn and overall cleanliness downstairs made it unaccpetable for us to stay almost immediately. I had to book a hotel room at the airport which worked out fine for us but the reaction from the management company was that we cancelled without giving them a chance to resolve the issue. There simply was no way my wife and I could have stayed there after the first 5 minutes in the place so there was no way we wanted to stay there and so cancelled immediately. The complaint and refund request is now passed to Airbnd Resolution Centre this week commencing 20/7/20 so I will feedback what they say on here when they eventually get round to updating the complaint/refund request which currently stands at zero from the host/managing company."

My booking was showing that it has been comfirmed by my host. I tried to reach my host on several occasion to no avail and given i had to arrived Liege, Belgium the following day. I finally travelled. Knowing everythg was ok as confirm by Airbnb and my trip iternary was send to me by Airbnb. To my greatest surprise upon arrival at the apartment. I was told to wait for the host, after waiting outside for a longtime, the host arrived only to tell me she wasn't aware of my booking, that she didn't accept my booking. I was shock and told her everythg was showing confirm on the Airbnb platform and all she could say was it most have been an automatic message from Airbnb. Given it was my first time in Liege and i knew nobody and had many luggages that i couldn't just carry and start moving around. Seriously i was frustrated in Liege, my Host couldn't help me out. And all i got from her was she will contact Airbnb, for them to fix the issue and refund me the full amount i spent. Also, i had to plead with her just to charge my phone because it was low and after i pleaded sereval time just to get the phone power up. So that i could see how to book for my return ticket. Since then I have tried to get hold of Airbnb customer support to no avail, by calling and messaging. No respond, don't understand anything. Very bad customer support service. After all what i went through, i got nothing at the end and my money i don't even knw when i will get it back. Infact i am highly dissappointed with Airbnb. I need the full refund... you guys can't just take peoples money and don't reply them. That my had end money and i won't take it likely with Airbnb. So i am calling you people to refund me my full amount."

I called airbnb and asked them if they can protect me from a potential revenge review when I asked the guests for damage compensation. Airbnb said ""Yes!"". Then I send the photos of the damage to the guests and asked for £61.00 damage compensation. The guests didn't payed it and insted left me a horrible revenge review. Airbnb didn't deleted the review and took my apartment off the listing and I also lost my super host status for all my 9 apartments. My hotel is at the beach but far from the town centre and I only get many bookings  when I am a super host with excellent reviews. No I am loosing my business. Very bad support from airbnb!"

I have been trying diligently to get a refund for a reservation I had for 2 nights in Vancouver with G$%#k June 12-14th. I was spending 2 nights there while waiting for a cruise to AK on June 14th.  I was notified on Apr 15th that due to the pandemic the cruise was cancelled. I immediately started the process of cancelling everything associated with this trip. On Apr 16th I submitted a refund rqst for the full amt of $286.74, which was half of the total reservation. The host returned only $22.30 of the money I had pd and referred me to his cancel policy.  I then responded back with please refund my money as this cancellation was out of my control and a very unfortunate situation.  G@#$k, again referred to his cancel policy. I then reached out to Airbnb to assist me in this matter.  What I rec'd from them was this, 'Upon reviewing your case, we are able to confirm that this does not fall on our COVID-19 Extenuating Circumstance Policy. Our current policy only covers reservations until May 31st, and we don't have any update yet for June 1st onward. Due to this we are unable to override the host's cancellation policy to refund you in full.I would also like to inform you that we have reached out to G*&^k, and we are able to confirm that he didn't agree with the refund outside his cancellation policy. I have again reached out for the help of Airbnb because their new Covid-19 guidelines have an Aug 31 end date. They, stated the very same thing, G*&^k said, blah, blah, blah!!! I have sent them a copy of their new, updated Covid-19 exceptions guidelines and rqst'd help again in getting my money refunded.  There is no doubt they will again be spineless and do nothing. As much as I have enjoyed my experiences with Airbnb, I am severing my ties and will spread the word that they are not a fair and supportive company."

We found a nice little cottage on the dates we wanted at a reasonable price, and started to get excited.Then, when trying to actually book the property, AirBnb decided to start making me jump through hoops to 'validate my Goverment ID'. 1) Why do you need my ID to book a property online?2) Why is your software so poor, that it can't even validate the picture on my driving license against a picture of my driving license?!I contacted support who told me that this issue needed to be dealt with by their technical team and I should be contacted in the next 24 hours. Problem is - all bookings are automatically cancelled if they aren't paid for in 12 hours.Still haven't heard from support 5 days later, and the property is now booked by someone else.Awful service, awful system, avoid like the plague."

I was on the phone for hours and messaged them for help and refund but they said that cancellations will not be refunded. I never cancelled but never got the keys to the apartment. Airbnb confirmed they had suspended the host account before then and they already knew the host was uncontactable on their platform and phone but never informed us.  But they keep providing automated responses on email and never actually assigned us a case worker to work on a simple refund for accommodation not provided. We had to find alternate car and accommodation due to their incompetence and no sign of refund on the monies we paid for nonexistent accommodation. It basically ruined our holiday. Absolute shambles and borders on fraudulent transaction. I have no idea how to get back my money for accommodation they never provided. They need to be held responsible , if this were a hotel, we would get an apology with a refund. In this case, they refused to even acknowledge there is a problem, saying we cannot get a refund unless it was Covid related. No this is just business, if you cannot provide a service, give the refund and losses we incurred. Nothing to do with Covid. Refusing to refund for accommodation that was never available to begin with, and thinking they can get away with seems incredulous."

However the catch is 'continuous access' meaning the WiFi is basically disturbed, weak, unreliable, impossible to use. Of course, as a customer you have no idea what it actually means when booking the listing property/room. My husband works remotely and we book the flat in Portugal for 5 nights. WiFi was so weak I couldn't send an email. I contacted host who said it is out his/her control. I called Airbnb at 7 30am. I haven't stop dealing with them until 7pm, whole day on about seven phone call, which lasted up to an hour, waiting in long line. Airbnb kept telling me they are solving the issue with a host,didn't return the calls, made me believe they want to relocate me but actually not even considering it. They haven't mentioned what 'continuous access' means until about 6pm when they explained that the host actually said there is no reliable WiFi so I have no right to complain. They wasted my time, my husband's day of work, my money on all the international calls without any understanding. I have used Airbnb for about 10 years but I have never complain. I believe this was a small issue for a giant like Airbnb and they couldn't deal with it. I am not longer going to use their platform."

But due to Covid crisis; we have to cancel our Greece holiday, just because the consulate accepted our visa application and garanteed us to fly Greece after date 15 July.On 15th July, a new updated information emerge and Greece has been cancelled all flight from Turkey so our plan has to be cancelled and we have talked our host to refund the amount.The host mentioned about penalty of AirB&B when he cancels the reservation and asked for us to text the support team.Then I wrote the team and at first dear Daniel showed me a warm message that if the host accept to cancel then I can take the refund just only without service fee for AirB&B and this is also okey for us.Cutting service fee is acceptable since noone knows what to do on this Covid days.But then Daniel told me that the host has not accept to cancel and wanted to apply normal day refund policy as %50 refundable.And this is not good for us but still can be acceptableAnd I asked the host again to do a fair; he showed me the messages between he and Daniel; the support team wrote the host not to cancel reservation, because it is our responsibilty to know Covid crisis travel details.So, what we expect from this company as a client is not to advise anyone to cancel or not; the expectation is balance between both.When our host accepts to cancel and he just demand not to have penalty and as customer I accept to pay service fee of AirB&B; the company should say okey at least for one time; but Daniel just try to cheat us and lie us the fact that they advise the host not to cancel rather then balance of us.And before this problem; another host was cancelled our house due to Covid and no one pay us anything!Why we have to pay as client and the host does not pay us anything when they cancel due to Covid.. It is not fair. The real hospitaly can only be seen when people have crisis and this company failed lots of times.We have never want to use them again and hope a new fair platform will be emerged and AirB&B will continue to cheat and lie people."

I reached out right away to the airbnb customer service requesting information. They apologized on the phone and said that the they will create an expedited ticket for the terms and condition department to reach out. In the meantime there was no way i could get the same booking. My friend was barely able to get some other house, a lot more expensive so we didnt lose our plane tickets and missed on the 4th of July weekend. They finally reached out to me about 1 week later that my account was finally reinstated, but no explanation as to what happened. They had about three weeks to reach out since i booked regarding this unknown ""violation"" but they reached out last minute. With everything thats going on, you would think they would be more careful with the way they deal with things. When they finally reached out a week later, I asked about what i violated, but their only response was that my account was reinstated, like that was enough. Guess what, you can go ahead and close that account airbnb. No need for it when I am not planning to use it. At least i dont have to deal with this when i book a hotel. Thanks for nothing airbnb."

A client has canceled their reservation and I did not receive any compensation and the client did not present any medical justification that they could not attend the reservation.  This leads me to believe that Airbnb does not have the capacity to opérate in Europe due to the fact that they are not following the laws established and are incoherent with the application of their on strict policy  Vecause of this there is already being prepared a global class action law suit against this illegal application of their own policies we invite you to join in the clas action suit if you were affected by the mis-application of Airbnb policies.

However, they are COLLECTING THEIR FEES ON TIME :( Also, they jack my nightly rate up and down at will even though I do not use smart pricing. Sometimes they hide my listing so it can't be found. They also add promos that I don't know about that are buried deep in the software behind other benign subtexted items that you don't know about unless you actually trip over them.

When we arrived, the pool had been closed for months!  If they have time to change the ad to include a Covid cleaning fee, they should change the ad that the pool is currently closed. (The locals told us it had been closed for months.). No one will offer any reimbursement. We had SEVERAL other options for much cheaper and closer to mountain biking and ONLY chose this house for the pool.  We had to go buy our own dish soap, (told it a text it wasn’t part of the package) and our own paper towels. Didn’t have a grill because when we asked about a propane tank they said it was out and they would send someone. When someone arrived with propane he discovered it was connected to the house.  We were down to the last roll of toilet paper. Seriously disappointing!!!I will never use Turnkey again!!"
